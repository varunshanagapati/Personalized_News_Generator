Rates are forecast to be brought down to 4.75% at that point.Political reactionIn response to the figures Chancellor Rachel Reeves said:""I am under no illusion about the scale of the challenge we face and I will be honest with the British people that change will not happen overnight.

It was like someone putting you in a room and there's no way out of it. I felt vulnerable, 100%.""If they had done their homework they would have realised I was wrongly arrested, wrongly convicted and wrongly jailed.""His legal team said: ""Oliver suffered severe brain damage as a baby.""His intelligence is borderline defective with an impaired capacity to process or remember more than the simplest verbal information, severely restricted reasoning skills and poor concentration and memory.""Part of the evidence against Campbell was his hat, which was found at the scene and he admitted was his but had been taken off him by someone several days before the robbery.The hat contained hairs but none of them belonged to Mr Campbell.The gunman was also said to be right-handed, while Mr Campbell is left-handed.The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) previously referred Mr Campbell's case to the Court of Appeal, arguing his conviction should be quashed.He had lost his first appeal, had a second application for appeal turned down by the CCRC but then persuaded it he did have a good case.Mr Campbell was freed on licence in 2002 and has been living under restrictions meaning he needs permission to get a job and is prevented from travelling abroad.Read more from Sky News:Taylor swift posts statement endorsing Kamala HarrisDave Grohl reveals he's become father 'outside of my marriage'Lord Justice Holroyde, sitting with Mr Justice Bourne and Mrs Justice Stacey, said the rulings might be different ""in the light of fresh evidence"".""A jury knowing of the fresh evidence would be considering the reliability of those confessions in a materially different context,"" Lord Justice Holroyde added.""In those circumstances, we cannot say that the fresh evidence could not reasonably have affected the decision of the jury to convict.""Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsThe Metropolitan Police issued a statement responding to the ruling: ""The murder of Baldev Singh Hoondle in July 1990 was fully investigated by detectives at the time with a range of evidence brought before a jury who convicted the defendant the following year.""We are aware of today's decision by the Court of Appeal in relation to Mr Campbell's conviction.

10-09-2024,SkyNews,UK,Winter fuel payment changes - are you still eligible?,"The winter fuel payment has been scrapped for millions of pensioners.The government announced the change at the end of July, along with a raft of other cuts to fill a  22bn ""black hole"" in public finances.MPs have now voted to allow the controversial plan to go ahead, which Chancellor Rachel Reeves says will save about  1.5bn each year.The payment is aimed at helping pensioners pay for higher fuel bills during the colder months, but now only the country's poorest pensioners will get financial aid.Wondering if you're still eligible for the payment?Here is what you need to know:Who is now eligible for the winter fuel payment?The winter fuel payment will now be limited to people over state pension age who are receiving pension credit or a limited number of other benefits.These benefits are: Income support; income-based jobseeker's allowance; income-related employment and support allowance; universal credit.The changes mean about 1.5 million people will be eligible - down from 11.4 million when the payment was available to anyone over the age of 66.How much is the payment?The payment is  200 for households receiving pension credit where the recipients are all under 80.If someone in the household is over the age of 80, the payment is increased to  300.What were the rules before?Previously, the payments were available to everyone above state pension age.Last year, the base rate of  200 was paid to everyone born before 25 September 1957, while those born before 25 September 1943 received  300.This was boosted by a  300 per household pensioner cost of living payment.How is the payment made?Most people get the winter fuel payment automatically, and those eligible should receive a letter in the autumn saying how much they will get.Read more from Sky News:How would an outdoor smoking ban work?How could the government change council tax?Voter ID rules 'discouraged' some people from voting in general electionKeep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsWho is eligible for pension credit?Pension credit is available to pensioners whose income falls below a certain threshold - the payment tops up their income to this amount.For people with a partner, income is calculated together.Income includes state and private pensions, earnings, and social security benefits including a carer's allowance.But not everything counts as income - disability payments, housing benefit, and council tax reduction are among the benefits that aren't counted.Pension credit tops up your weekly income to  218.15 if you're single and  332.95 if you have a partner.Pension credit is often described as a ""gateway benefit"" as it can lead to further support, including help with housing costs, council tax and heating bills.Previous estimates published by the government indicated up to 850,000 households who were entitled to receive pension credit in 2019-20 did not claim the benefit.The benefit can be claimed by phone and online, and an online calculator can help pensioners check if they are likely to be eligible and get an estimate of what they may receive.

What happened to integrity? It went out of the window,"" Mr Stride said.Labour MP Rachel Maskell - who has been outspoken in her opposition to the plan - told the Commons of pensioners ""frightened"" to turn on the lights in case they cannot pay their bills.""It's with my conscience that I cannot vote for these measures,"" she said.Labour's Debbie Abrahams was also critical of the move, saying many of the government's measures to ease costs on households would not be in place for this winter.Earlier, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer faced down critics as he told union members gathered at the TUC conference in Brighton that he ""owes working people the respect of economic stability"" and makes ""no apologies for any of the decisions we've had to take to begin the work of change"".What has the chancellor said about the change?Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the decision to scrap winter fuel payments for some pensioners was a ""difficult"" one she did not want to make.""This level of overspend is not sustainable,"" she said.""Left unchecked, it is a risk to economic stability and, unlike the party opposite, I will never take risks with our country's economic stability.""Ms Reeves said while the government would continue to protect the pension triple lock - the measure to raise state pensions every year by the level of average earnings, inflation or 2.5% - the winter fuel payment would no longer be universal.""Let me be clear, this is not a decision I wanted to make, nor is it the one I expected to make - but these are the necessary and urgent decisions that I must make,"" she said.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerWhat has the response been?Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, warned the targeting of the payments was ""too narrow with the winter we have coming"", adding: ""The energy price cap is likely to rise 10% this October and stay high across the winter, leaving most energy bills nearly double those pre-crisis, at levels unaffordable for millions.""Many pensioners eke out the  100 to  300 winter fuel payments to allow them to keep some heating on through the cold months.""While there's an argument for ending its universality due to tight national finances, it's being squeezed to too narrow a group - just those on benefits and pension credit. Yet again, those just above the thresholds will be hardest hit.""Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeCaroline Abrahams from Age UK said the charity strongly opposes the means-testing of the winter fuel payment.""A big reason for this disastrous outcome is that more than one in three pensioners entitled to pension credit, the qualifying benefit for [winter fuel payment] under this proposal, don't receive it, a proportion that's been roughly constant for many years.""It is well established that pensioners tend to do everything possible to avoid going into debt, so if they are worried about their future energy bills, we know their likely response will be to ration their fuel use and economise by reducing their spending on other essentials.""This proposed policy change is therefore certain to result in more older people experiencing a horrible eating or heating dilemma.""",https://news.sky.com/story/winter-fuel-payment-changes-are-you-still-eligible-13187277

09-09-2024,SkyNews,UK,Anti-social behaviour concerns: Thousands of communities say their fears aren't being taken seriously by authorities,"A loud crash jolts Paul Wheeler into waking up in the middle of the night.As he peers out of his bedroom window, which overlooks the park at the back of his home in a quiet, suburban part of Kent, he sees a shadowy figure setting fire to something.It's a warm summer night, Labour is celebrating its landslide election win. For the first time in 14 years, there is a new government in place, which has made big promises on crime.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerAs the flames rage close to his garden fence, Paul, 46, starts to film the drama unfolding outside his home, while his two children sleep soundly in the next room.""You need to ring 999 right now,"" he tells his wife. ""People are setting light to something right by the gate at the front of the park.""Then there's an explosion and smoke fills the air.For the last four years, gangs of mainly teenagers have caused trouble in the park behind Paul's house, terrorising him and his neighbours. He pleaded with the council to install CCTV but his request was turned down.The next morning, the charred remains of a motorbike lie at the park entrance. The gate is damaged and the ground is covered in debris including bits of wire, nuts and bolts. The flames have turned the leaves of a large tree a rusty brown.Paul's experience mirrors that of thousands of other communities around Britain who say their concerns about anti-social behaviour, which includes anything from vandalism to public drunkenness and noise disturbances, aren't being taken seriously by police and local councils.One million incidents a yearA landmark report by the victims' commissioner for England and Wales, Baroness Newlove, details a failure by those agencies to respond to the one million incidents of anti-social behaviour recorded every year by police.The report finds that two-thirds of people (63%) who reported anti-social behaviour said their problem had not been resolved.The majority, more than 60%, reported it to multiple agencies.And a staggering 70% said they received no support at all.For people like Paul, living with anti-social behaviour has taken a heavy toll on his mental health. ""It makes you fearful,"" he says. ""It gives us massive amounts of anxiety and stress.""His neighbour Jackie Beamiss, 68, has also experienced feelings of despair over the disturbances in the park. Calling and emailing Kent Police, writing to her local MP and the council, are all actions she says she has taken over the past four years.""I'm fed up with nobody listening to us or appreciating how serious it can be,"" says Jackie, who has been dealing with this on top of a breast cancer diagnosis. ""I feel too intimidated to even let my dog out in the back garden.""Neighbourhood Watch coordinator Garry Turner says the message they get back from the police is they need more evidence. ""You can't get more evidence than what has been provided. And we're still not getting the response we deserve,"" he adds.One in three experience or see anti-social behaviourAccording to the Crime Survey for England and Wales, published in March, 35% of people have experienced or witnessed some type of anti-social behaviour.The findings reveal deep-rooted problems in some communities, driven by economic hardship, social fragmentation and the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.Back in Wilmot Park, Paul is still upset by what he witnessed on the night of the fire and thinks the police took too long to respond. It appears to have been an attack on a gate at the park entrance that was installed by the council in 2023.Kent Police told Sky News they are ""aware of local concerns"" and working with Dartford Borough Council to address these issues. They said they attended the incident with the motorbike ""within hours"" but haven't caught those responsible.In a statement, they added: ""We have teams who regularly patrol the area and also have a dedicated beat officer who residents can talk to directly.""A spokesperson for Dartford Borough Council said: ""We fully understand that any anti-social behaviour (ASB) is incredibly frustrating for residents and has a negative impact on the wider community.""In relation to Wilmot Park we will continue to respond to incidents of ASB where we have the evidence and powers to do so, and have also increased our park ranger presence in the park in recent months.""Previous approaches have been too reactive, focusing on punishment rather than prevention, according to Baroness Newlove, whose husband Garry was kicked to death by a gang of youths in 2007, after he confronted them outside the family home in Warrington, Cheshire.""It's been 17 years since Garry's life was taken. It saddens and angers me that anti-social behaviour is still being classed as low level, a misdemeanour.""Victims are forced to jump hurdle after hurdle to get the response they deserve. They have to be taken more seriously.""Despite numerous attempts by successive governments to address the problem, the issue has continued to plague communities.The new government says combating anti-social behaviour is a central focus of its policy agenda.

10-09-2024,SkyNews,UK,Labour won't want to be associated with austerity - but it's creeping into the debate,"The government comfortably won another vote today but, while Starmer has the numbers behind him to withstand opposition - including from his own party - he is under pressure to change his gloomy tune.As many as 52 Labour MPs refused to support the government's plan to axe the winter fuel payment for all but the poorest pensioners, with one outright voting against the policy. It comes just months after the government won a vote to maintain the two-child benefit cap.It's understood that only 12 of those absences were unauthorised, with the government appearing sanguine about the result. Yet, there are more than a few murmurings of discontent.Politics live: Candidate eliminated from race to replace SunakWhile the party was elected on a mandate to ""change Britain"" and ""fix public services,"" it's increasingly being associated with phrases like ""austerity"" and ""benefit cuts.""Taking a leaf out of the coalition government's 2010 playbook, the government is trying to shape a different narrative: that ""difficult decisions"" are the result of the previous government's recklessness.It's not a straightforward sell. The arithmetic might back Sir Keir, but his message won't necessarily wash with a weary public - or with MPs.Many of them laid out their stalls ahead of the vote in a debate that featured a series of impassioned speeches.The most notable came from Labour's own MPs, with the likes of Rachael Maskell and Neil Duncan-Jordan calling for the policy to be delayed, signalling that they would rebel against their own party. Both abstained.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsJon Trickett, the one Labour MP who outright voted against the policy, now awaits his fate. He will have seen how the leadership treated the seven MPs who rebelled against the party's stance on the two-child benefit cap.

He said: ""I do regret voting for a motion put forth by [Tories], but I will have to because there's no other mechanism.

Their route back into the Labour Party now looks more uncertain. The remaining two, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Imran Hussain, abstained.While the government comfortably won the vote, the narrative they have tried to cement since winning the election came under strain from opposition MPs. The government argues that the withdrawal of support to all pensioners is necessary to salvage the public finances and fix the economy.It was a line repeated by Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, who sounded a lot like the last Conservative chancellor Jeremy Hunt when she said: ""We must fix the foundations of our economy"" and ""When money is tight"" tough decisions have to be made.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeRead more:State pension to rise by more than  400Sign ups for pension credit doubles Starmer: Cutting fuel payment will stabilise economyIn this battle of competing narratives, the notion was repeatedly challenged.

10-09-2024,SkyNews,UK,Early release of thousands of prisoners is deeply unpopular - so will it work?,"Today's release is the chance for hundreds of prisoners to turn their lives around - or to go back to their old ways.It's also crunch time to turn around the woeful situation in our overcrowded jails that has led to this decision. Can it work? Can the prison system be fixed?Tuesday's cohort of early leavers are those serving sentences of less than five years, and on 22 October it will be the turn of those with sentences of five years or more - but the government insists it won't apply to most serious offenders such as killers, rapists and terrorists.Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the scheme would free up space for 5,500 offenders. The alternative, she told me, would be ""unthinkable"" - judges no longer able to hand down sentences because there is no room to house new offenders.However unpopular, the move is much needed - and it still might not be enough.Prisons in England and Wales are almost full.Official figures for 6 September 2024 showed the total prison population to be 88,521.Useable operational capacity for the system stands at 89,619.But that really is the top end, most prisons are already over-stuffed.As well as ""operational capacity"" you can also measure capacity by ""certified normal accommodation"" (CNA).Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeThis is the number of people that can be held in each prison in safe and decent accommodation.

10-09-2024,SkyNews,UK,Sir Keir Starmer appears to woo TUC - but trouble remains in Westminster ,"When Sir Tony Blair used to address the TUC conference, the joke was that he told his driver to keep the car engine running.Sir Keir Starmer didn't hang about here. He did take six questions after his speech, but he left the stage swiftly after that.In fairness, the prime minister had pressing business in parliament, where his pesky backbenchers were still - as he left Brighton - threatening a rebellion on winter fuel payments.Politics latest: MPs debate cut to winter fuel paymentsBut in the 40 minutes he was on the platform, Sir Keir delivered a predictably tough message to the unions: don't expect big pay rises under a Labour government.His Tory opponents would claim it's a bit late for that message since the government has already offered inflation-busting pay rises to train drivers and junior doctors.Given his tough tone, his reception here was never going to reach rock star proportions. And - harsh but fair - Sir Keir is never going to be a rock star politician like Sir Tony, Boris Johnson or Barack Obama.But he did receive a standing ovation after his speech and Q&A, though not from everyone in the hall - and there were a few empty seats.And twice during his speech, a lone female heckler shouted: ""Tax the rich!"" And no, it wasn't Unite general secretary Sharon Graham, who'd made that demand in a fiery conference speech the previous day.The key phrases in Sir Keir's warning on pay were phrases like ""I have to level with you"", ""this will take a while"", ""tough decisions"" and ""I owe you that candour"".Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsBut the phrase that really stood out in the speech was ""working people"". He said it no fewer than 19 times. The message here was that despite all the accusations of austerity measures in the short term, the government is on the side of working people.When it came to questions, the only challenging one of the six was on why Labour had not axed George Osborne's two-child benefit cap. He talked about tackling child poverty, but didn't give a definitive answer.He must have been relieved that there was no question on winter fuel payments, although the suspicion at TUC conferences has always been that questions from the floor to a Labour leader are heavily vetted by the general secretary and his inner circle.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerRead more:MPs to vote on cutting winter fuel paymentVote will test Sir Keir's authoritySir Keir had, of course, come to Brighton with good news and bad news. The good news was his commitment on Labour's pledges on workers' rights, which the unions are delighted about and grateful for. The bad news was on pay.This was the first speech at a TUC conference by a Labour prime minister for 15 years, since Gordon Brown in Liverpool in 2009, when - yes, really - Irn Broon warned of spending cuts to come.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeBack then, Labour's 13 years in government were coming to an end. Within a year of that Liverpool speech, Mr Brown had lost the 2010 election.Sir Keir's speech in Brighton, in contrast, came in the early weeks of a new Labour government. Surely a better time - especially with a stonking Commons majority - to warn of ""tough decisions"" than after more than 12 years in power.  Tap here to follow Politics at Jack and Sam's wherever you get your podcasts  For that reason - and because the unions are so delighted to see the back of a Tory government after 13 years - most union leaders and activists here were prepared to give Sir Keir the benefit of the doubt on his tough economic message.For now.For Sir Keir, job done. Only a minor heckle and no walkouts or placard held up during his speech.And his swift departure after the post-speech handshakes confirmed that the prime minister had bigger troubles to attend to back at Westminster.",https://news.sky.com/story/sir-keir-starmer-appears-to-woo-tuc-but-trouble-remains-in-westminster-13212353

To do so would be speculative.""I am not satisfied that events on Jeremy Kyle Show gave rise to a clear link that caused or contributed to the death of Steven Dymond such that I should be recording this as a contributing factor.""Steven Dymond had a history of a diagnosed personality disorder and mental illness which presented on a number of occasions before any appearance of the Jemery Kyle Show and resulted in Steve Dymond self-harming or displaying thoughts of suicide.""Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player'No dissatisfaction' over treatment during filmingMr Pegg went on to say: ""[Mr Dymond's] decision to take his own life was made in the context of his mental distress that was probably exacerbated by his belief that a significant relationship had now irretrievably broken down following his participation on a television programme where it had been suggested that the deceased had lied to his partner.""Mr Dymond had taken a lie detector test for the ITV programme after being accused of cheating on his ex-fiancee Jane Callaghan. Clips from the unaired show were played during the inquest.The court was told Mr Dymond had been ""booed"" by the audience at the reveal of the test results, and told a researcher after filming had finished: ""I wish I was dead.""Mr Dymond was later described to the court as being left ""broken"" and ""distraught"" after appearing on the show.Mr Pegg said there was ""insufficient evidence"" to say whether or not Mr Dymond had indeed lied during the lie detector test.Noting ITV's aftercare support, offered after filming, the coroner said: ""Aftercare records indicate [Mr Dymond] was 'emotionally contained' and expressed no dissatisfaction towards his treatment during the recording with a plan for follow up CBT [cognitive behavioural therapy] support.""The court heard that the last known contact with Mr Dymond was on the evening of 6 May 2019.

It has also spent  2.4bn procuring new equipment for Kyiv.The MoD told the NAO the cost of replenishing British stockpiles is set to vastly outweigh the value of the donated equipment, and said it expects to spend  2.71bn up to 2030-31.Read more on Sky News:TV star calls for apology from PMMultiple bodies found on Mont BlancKeep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsIn the report, the MoD said the discrepancy was because the UK is buying newer equipment which in some cases was more advanced than the kit donated to Ukraine.It comes after Defence Secretary John Healey announced last week Operation Interflex would continue throughout the next year.The minister met his European counterparts and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at a defence summit in Germany last week.The NAO investigation did not seek to evaluate the strategic case for supporting Ukraine or reach conclusions on value for money, but was intended only to set out the facts regarding what support was being provided.",https://news.sky.com/story/british-army-constrained-in-ability-to-train-troops-over-ukrainian-soldier-operations-report-says-13212687

Businesses can be given penalties of up to  2,500 for failing to enforce the rules.An outdoor ban would likely apply the same rules to most outdoor spaces - including some parks, all pub gardens, outdoor restaurants, sports venues, and areas outside nightclubs and hospitals.Details on all the venues covered by the proposal and what the fines would be are yet to be released.Why has the ban been proposed?When asked to confirm the outdoor ban rumours, the prime minister said: ""My starting point on this is to remind everyone that over 80,000 people lose their lives every year to smoking, that's a preventable death, it's a huge burden on the NHS and of course to the taxpayer"".He promised to ""take decisions in this space"" to ""reduce the burden on the NHS and the taxpayer"".Smoking is the UK's biggest preventable killer, causing around one in four cancer deaths and leading to 64,000 deaths per year in England, according to Dr Javed Khan's 2022 review into making smoking obsolete.It is hoped the plans will prevent tens of thousands of deaths and save the NHS billions of pounds.Will it work?Hospitality businesses are sceptical the plans are enforceable, however.Reem Ibrahim, acting director of communications at the Institute of Economic Affairs thinktank, said they would be ""another nail in the coffin for the pub industry"".""Pubs and other private venues should be able to determine their own outdoor smoking rules - just as they should be allowed to decide whether to play music, serve food or show football on TV,"" he added.Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality echoed his concerns, saying the plans will also affect hotels, cafes, and restaurants.She pointed to the number of pub closures after the indoor smoking bans of 2006 and 2007 - and called for businesses to be consulted before any measures are implemented.What about 14s and under?Rishi Sunak's Conservative government proposed to ban anyone who was born on or after 1 January 2009 from buying cigarette or tobacco products.This would effectively raise the legal age for buying cigarettes in England by one year every year, until it applies to the whole population.Labour has said it will continue with the plans, laying out the Tobacco and Vapes Bill in the King's Speech in July.This will also include limits on the sale and marketing of vapes - but exact details have not been published yet.As with previous plans, smoking would not be criminalised. Instead, the phased approach means those who are already old enough to buy cigarettes will be able to carry on doing so.Older people, however, may have to carry ID if they want to buy cigarettes when the law changes.Will the under-14 ban stop young people smoking?There is ""excellent evidence"" increasing the legal age for buying tobacco from 16 to 18 in the UK ""substantially reduced smoking prevalence"", according to Jamie Brown, professor of behavioural science at University College London (UCL).""This provides good reason to expect this measure to have a similar impact,"" he said.Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said the ban was ""creeping prohibition"" and will not work.""Anyone who wants to smoke will buy tobacco abroad or from illicit sources,"" he said.Are there any similar bans around the world?New Zealand passed a similar ban, but it was repealed by the country's new coalition government before it came into force.How much of the population will be affected?In 2022, 12.9% of the adult UK population (6.4 million people) were smokers, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).As for the 'smoke-free generation', 21% of the UK population is currently not allowed to buy cigarettes due to their age.But assuming the age of sale rises to 19 in 2027, and increases by one year every year after that, the proportion of the population below the age of sale will reach 30% in 2035, 40% in 2044 and 50% in 2053.The ban only covers England - what about the other UK nations?The legal smoking age is a devolved issue, so the governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland set their own laws around it.Depending on what laws the other nations adopt, there could be a situation where is it illegal for someone to buy cigarettes or smoke in pub gardens in England, but legal across the border.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsWhat are the next steps?In the King's Speech at the opening of the new parliament, Labour said the Tobacco and Vapes Bill would be introduced by the end of this year.As with all legislation, it will need to be approved in the House of Commons and the House of Lords before being written into law.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeIf the government wants to stop people smoking, why not just ban cigarettes?Banning tobacco outright would not immediately stop the UK's 6.4 million smokers from smoking, Dr Sarah Jackson from UCL explains.""Because cigarettes are so highly addictive, many people would be unable or unwilling to do so, and a ban would likely drive demand towards the illicit market,"" she said.""Gradually increasing the age of sale over time... will be helpful in discouraging young people from taking up smoking in the first place.""What about vaping?This government and the previous one have both vowed to crack down on vaping among children.Vaping is ""rightly"" used as a tool to quit smoking, a spokesperson said, but they added: ""The health advice is clear, if you don't smoke, don't vape and children should never vape"".The name of the new bill reveals limits will be imposed on e-cigarettes.This could mean flavours being restricted and tighter regulations on packaging and point-of-sale displays.The ONS reported a rise in vaping among young people, with 15.5% of 16 to 24-year-olds reporting vaping daily or on occasion in 2022, up from 11.1% in 2021.",https://news.sky.com/story/how-would-an-outdoor-smoking-ban-work-and-who-would-be-part-of-the-smoke-free-generation-12977337
10-09-2024,SkyNews,Politics,Labour won't want to be associated with austerity - but it's creeping into the debate,"The government comfortably won another vote today but, while Starmer has the numbers behind him to withstand opposition - including from his own party - he is under pressure to change his gloomy tune.As many as 52 Labour MPs refused to support the government's plan to axe the winter fuel payment for all but the poorest pensioners, with one outright voting against the policy. It comes just months after the government won a vote to maintain the two-child benefit cap.It's understood that only 12 of those absences were unauthorised, with the government appearing sanguine about the result. Yet, there are more than a few murmurings of discontent.Politics live: Candidate eliminated from race to replace SunakWhile the party was elected on a mandate to ""change Britain"" and ""fix public services,"" it's increasingly being associated with phrases like ""austerity"" and ""benefit cuts.""Taking a leaf out of the coalition government's 2010 playbook, the government is trying to shape a different narrative: that ""difficult decisions"" are the result of the previous government's recklessness.It's not a straightforward sell. The arithmetic might back Sir Keir, but his message won't necessarily wash with a weary public - or with MPs.Many of them laid out their stalls ahead of the vote in a debate that featured a series of impassioned speeches.The most notable came from Labour's own MPs, with the likes of Rachael Maskell and Neil Duncan-Jordan calling for the policy to be delayed, signalling that they would rebel against their own party. Both abstained.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsJon Trickett, the one Labour MP who outright voted against the policy, now awaits his fate. He will have seen how the leadership treated the seven MPs who rebelled against the party's stance on the two-child benefit cap. They all lost the whip.John McDonnell, among that camp of seven MPs, signalled that he would vote against the government again. He said: ""I do regret voting for a motion put forth by [Tories], but I will have to because there's no other mechanism. And I say to my people in back in Hayes: I want to look at them in their face and say, I did the right thing.""He was joined by Zarah Sultana, Richard Burgon, Ian Byrne, and Apsana Begum. Their route back into the Labour Party now looks more uncertain. The remaining two, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Imran Hussain, abstained.While the government comfortably won the vote, the narrative they have tried to cement since winning the election came under strain from opposition MPs. The government argues that the withdrawal of support to all pensioners is necessary to salvage the public finances and fix the economy.It was a line repeated by Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, who sounded a lot like the last Conservative chancellor Jeremy Hunt when she said: ""We must fix the foundations of our economy"" and ""When money is tight"" tough decisions have to be made.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeRead more:State pension to rise by more than  400Sign ups for pension credit doubles Starmer: Cutting fuel payment will stabilise economyIn this battle of competing narratives, the notion was repeatedly challenged.

10-09-2024,SkyNews,Politics,Early release of thousands of prisoners is deeply unpopular - so will it work?,"Today's release is the chance for hundreds of prisoners to turn their lives around - or to go back to their old ways.It's also crunch time to turn around the woeful situation in our overcrowded jails that has led to this decision. Can it work? Can the prison system be fixed?Tuesday's cohort of early leavers are those serving sentences of less than five years, and on 22 October it will be the turn of those with sentences of five years or more - but the government insists it won't apply to most serious offenders such as killers, rapists and terrorists.Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the scheme would free up space for 5,500 offenders. The alternative, she told me, would be ""unthinkable"" - judges no longer able to hand down sentences because there is no room to house new offenders.However unpopular, the move is much needed - and it still might not be enough.Prisons in England and Wales are almost full.Official figures for 6 September 2024 showed the total prison population to be 88,521.Useable operational capacity for the system stands at 89,619.But that really is the top end, most prisons are already over-stuffed.As well as ""operational capacity"" you can also measure capacity by ""certified normal accommodation"" (CNA).Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeThis is the number of people that can be held in each prison in safe and decent accommodation. On this measurement 75 of the 122 prisons in England and Wales are at 100% capacity or over. The most packed is Durham at 172% capacity.All this has contributed to the ""devastating picture"" described in today's annual report by the chief inspector of prisons Charlie Taylor finding a surge in violence, drug use and self-harm along with a failure to rehabilitate prisoners.  Click to subscribe to the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcasts  All leading to Mr Taylor's assertion that many prisoners are in ""a revolving door"", with untreated mental health and drug problems.Often with nowhere to live when they come out, they re-offend - sometimes to feed a drug habit they acquired in prison.Mr Taylor told Sky News: ""That of course, just creates more victims of crime, more mayhem in communities and a prison population that is now almost unmanageable.""Read more:Prisoners welcome early releaseEarly release inmates could be housed in hotelsOne prisoner coming out on early release this morning even admitted to us there was a ""99% chance"" he will get recalled due to his bail conditions, while another said they were released to become homeless.So, losing 5,500 prisoners will give breathing space - but will still leave prisons incredibly stretched, under-resourced and at current re-offending rates, about 1,375 of the released inmates will be back soon.According to the Institute for Government, the growth in the population has been driven by longer sentences, with average custodial sentences now 25% longer than they were in 2012.

10-09-2024,SkyNews,Politics,Winter fuel payment changes - are you still eligible?,"The winter fuel payment has been scrapped for millions of pensioners.The government announced the change at the end of July, along with a raft of other cuts to fill a  22bn ""black hole"" in public finances.MPs have now voted to allow the controversial plan to go ahead, which Chancellor Rachel Reeves says will save about  1.5bn each year.The payment is aimed at helping pensioners pay for higher fuel bills during the colder months, but now only the country's poorest pensioners will get financial aid.Wondering if you're still eligible for the payment?Here is what you need to know:Who is now eligible for the winter fuel payment?The winter fuel payment will now be limited to people over state pension age who are receiving pension credit or a limited number of other benefits.These benefits are: Income support; income-based jobseeker's allowance; income-related employment and support allowance; universal credit.The changes mean about 1.5 million people will be eligible - down from 11.4 million when the payment was available to anyone over the age of 66.How much is the payment?The payment is  200 for households receiving pension credit where the recipients are all under 80.If someone in the household is over the age of 80, the payment is increased to  300.What were the rules before?Previously, the payments were available to everyone above state pension age.Last year, the base rate of  200 was paid to everyone born before 25 September 1957, while those born before 25 September 1943 received  300.This was boosted by a  300 per household pensioner cost of living payment.How is the payment made?Most people get the winter fuel payment automatically, and those eligible should receive a letter in the autumn saying how much they will get.Read more from Sky News:How would an outdoor smoking ban work?How could the government change council tax?Voter ID rules 'discouraged' some people from voting in general electionKeep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsWho is eligible for pension credit?Pension credit is available to pensioners whose income falls below a certain threshold - the payment tops up their income to this amount.For people with a partner, income is calculated together.Income includes state and private pensions, earnings, and social security benefits including a carer's allowance.But not everything counts as income - disability payments, housing benefit, and council tax reduction are among the benefits that aren't counted.Pension credit tops up your weekly income to  218.15 if you're single and  332.95 if you have a partner.Pension credit is often described as a ""gateway benefit"" as it can lead to further support, including help with housing costs, council tax and heating bills.Previous estimates published by the government indicated up to 850,000 households who were entitled to receive pension credit in 2019-20 did not claim the benefit.The benefit can be claimed by phone and online, and an online calculator can help pensioners check if they are likely to be eligible and get an estimate of what they may receive.

What happened to integrity? It went out of the window,"" Mr Stride said.Labour MP Rachel Maskell - who has been outspoken in her opposition to the plan - told the Commons of pensioners ""frightened"" to turn on the lights in case they cannot pay their bills.""It's with my conscience that I cannot vote for these measures,"" she said.Labour's Debbie Abrahams was also critical of the move, saying many of the government's measures to ease costs on households would not be in place for this winter.Earlier, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer faced down critics as he told union members gathered at the TUC conference in Brighton that he ""owes working people the respect of economic stability"" and makes ""no apologies for any of the decisions we've had to take to begin the work of change"".What has the chancellor said about the change?Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the decision to scrap winter fuel payments for some pensioners was a ""difficult"" one she did not want to make.""This level of overspend is not sustainable,"" she said.""Left unchecked, it is a risk to economic stability and, unlike the party opposite, I will never take risks with our country's economic stability.""Ms Reeves said while the government would continue to protect the pension triple lock - the measure to raise state pensions every year by the level of average earnings, inflation or 2.5% - the winter fuel payment would no longer be universal.""Let me be clear, this is not a decision I wanted to make, nor is it the one I expected to make - but these are the necessary and urgent decisions that I must make,"" she said.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerWhat has the response been?Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, warned the targeting of the payments was ""too narrow with the winter we have coming"", adding: ""The energy price cap is likely to rise 10% this October and stay high across the winter, leaving most energy bills nearly double those pre-crisis, at levels unaffordable for millions.""Many pensioners eke out the  100 to  300 winter fuel payments to allow them to keep some heating on through the cold months.""While there's an argument for ending its universality due to tight national finances, it's being squeezed to too narrow a group - just those on benefits and pension credit.

It's the vote of the people now. It's not tied up in the federal government.

10-09-2024,SkyNews,World,Tim Walz: The arrest that changed his life - and how it shaped his political career,"""You have responsibilities to others. You can't afford to make foolish decisions.""Those are the words Tim Walz's wife Gwen said to him after he was arrested for drink-driving at the age of 31.Now Kamala Harris's vice president nominee, Mr Walz looks back on this as a defining incident in his life, describing it as a ""life-changing"" moment.Mr Walz, now 60 and running to be the Democratic vice president, offered to resign from his teaching job and permanently swapped alcohol for Diet Mountain Dew, he told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis while running for governor of Minnesota in 2018.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player23 September 1995Tim Walz was working as a geography teacher and football coach at a high school in Nebraska when he was stopped by police on 23 September 1995.He had not long got his teaching degree and met his wife of a year Gwen, who was also a teacher from Minnesota.He had been watching college football with some friends when he was pulled over going 96mph in a 55mph zone.According to court documents, the state police officer smelled alcohol on his breath and Mr Walz failed initial breath tests.He was taken to a nearby hospital for a blood test and booked into Dawes County Jail.Court documents show he had 0.128% alcohol in his blood, which was over the legal limit of 0.1%.His lawyer claimed Mr Walz initially thought the police car was chasing him because it came up so quickly behind him and didn't turn its lights on.Ultimately Mr Walz took a plea deal and the charge was reduced to reckless driving. He lost his licence and was fined $200 ( 152).'Real disappointed in himself'When the case came to court in March 1996, Mr Walz's defence lawyer said that as a high school teacher and role model to his students, he felt ""terrible"" and was ""real disappointed, I guess, in himself"".The arrest saw him give up his coaching position - and even offer his resignation to his principal because he ""felt so bad"".His boss convinced him to stay, however, so instead Mr Walz used the experience to warn his pupils of the dangers of drink-driving.He told the courtroom: ""It's just a dangerous situation. Not just to myself, but to others who aren't even involved with it.""Tim Walz's drink-driving arrest re-emerged in the media soon after Kamala Harris announced he was going to be her running mate this year.But there was some confusion over false claims he wasn't over the limit.When he was running for Congress in 2006, his campaign spokesperson told a local news outlet in Minnesota he was not drunk that night in 1995.She said of the decision to reduce the charge to reckless driving: ""The DUI charge was dropped for a reason: It wasn't true.""She claimed that hearing loss he suffered while with his National Guard artillery unit may have been the reason he failed sobriety tests.There were also false reports given by his team that he had been allowed to drive himself to the police station   where he was later allowed to leave of his own accord.Court documents have since shown no mention of any hearing issues   and that he was driven to Dawes County Jail by officers.Speaking to his local newspaper in the run-up to his 2018 election as governor, Mr Walz reflected on how his run-in with the law changed his perspective.His father, a school administrator, died when he was 19.In an interview, he said it left him feeling as though his life had been ""ripped up"" and, throwing caution to the wind, saw him take unnecessary risks.He had joined the National Guard two years before, but instead of pursuing a military career, he went to China. It was only the second time ever he had got on a plane. He spent a year teaching there, which coincided with the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.On his return to the US he moved from state to state - Nebraska to Texas to Arkansas - where he ended up working in a factory that made beds for tanning salons.Bridging dividesHe returned to Nebraska, took up his first US teaching post and a full-time job with the National Guard, with football coaching on the side.Before long he started dating his wife, whom he married in 1994. They have two children - daughter Hope who was born in 2001 and son Gus born in 2006.After the couple moved back to Minnesota, Mr Walz swapped the National Guard, where he had progressed to command sergeant major by the time he left in 2005, with politics.That year he ran for Congress in the Republican-leaning 1st district of Minnesota.Read moreWho is Tim Walz?Walz accused of lying about fertility treatmentAnalysis: Why Harris picked WalzDuring the campaign, he established himself as someone who could build bridges - in a traditionally Democrat state surrounded by the Republican rural heartlands of Wisconsin and Michigan.He gave an example of when he was still a teacher in 1999 - and one of his pupils wanted to start a gay-straight alliance - just three years after President Bill Clinton had signed the Defence of Marriage Act, effectively banning same-sex marriage.In his National Guard days, he had seen LGBT people threatened with discharge, and at school, pupils bullied by their peers for their sexuality.Seeing the potential to cut through to its critics, Mr Walz became the group's faculty adviser.He told a newspaper interview: ""It really needed to be the football coach, who was the soldier and was straight and was married.""After beating the Republican incumbent to take his House seat in 2007, he stayed there for 12 years, before successfully running for governor in 2018.When Kamala Harris announced him as her VP pick this year, she said: ""As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he's delivered for working families like his.""",https://news.sky.com/story/tim-walz-the-arrest-that-changed-his-life-and-how-it-shaped-his-political-career-13208883
10-09-2024,SkyNews,World,JD Vance: How vice-presidential candidate used his 'hillbilly' background to catapult himself to the top of US politics,"When JD Vance says he came from nothing, he really means it.There are plenty of clich s that seemingly encapsulate how a child born in poverty can go on to become a vice presidential candidate by the age of 39; it's almost the perfect example of the ""American Dream"".But Donald Trump's running mate isn't in this position in spite of his challenging upbringing - in many ways, he's there because of it.This is how JD Vance took his experiences as a self-proclaimed hillbilly and used them to write a bestselling book and propel himself to the top of politics.Hillbilly ElegyIn his 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy, Mr Vance, born into an impoverished household in southern Ohio, shares stories about his chaotic family life and about communities that had declined and seemed to lose hope.He details his own journey and how he navigated his dysfunctional family.Trump v Harris: How body language spoke as loudly as the wordsWhere did Donald Trump's pet-eating claims come from?Aggression, disrespect and insult - a confrontation that Trump has rarely facedThere's his grandmother, who he refers to as Mamaw, who helped raise him on ""tough love"" - and once doused his Papaw with gasoline and dropped a lit match to punish him for being unfaithful. He escaped with minor burns.Then there is his mother, who struggled to care for him as she battled a drug addiction and at one point forced him to provide a urine sample for her drug test.He analyses his experiences growing up in Ohio to reflect on why the working-class American region of Appalachia, which consists of 13 states from southern New York to northern Mississippi, changed from reliably Democratic to reliably Republican.He does this not just by looking at his family, but also at the troubled community around him. He highlights the impact the steel industry's struggles in the 1970s had on his city, along with the opioid crisis which plagued the country.""It is in Greater Appalachia where the fortunes of working-class whites seem dimmest. From low social mobility to poverty to divorce and drug addiction, my home is a hub of misery,"" he writes in the introduction.He goes on to say he identifies with the ""millions of working-class Americans who have no college degree"".""To these folks, poverty is the family tradition - their ancestors were day labourers in the southern slave economy, share-croppers after that, and machinists and millworkers during more recent times.""Americans call them hillbillies, rednecks or white trash. I call them neighbours, friends and family.""The book was written by Mr Vance in his late 20s/early 30s. By that point, he had gone on to serve in the Marine Corps, graduate from Yale Law School where he met his wife Usha, and become a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley.Critical acclaim - and some critiquesTo many liberal Americans struggling to understand why a wealthy New York businessman like Donald Trump was appealing to so many struggling working-class voters in the 2016 US election, the book was something of a revelation.And conservatives were also widely keen on the book, which criticised the welfare system and what Vance saw as ""too many young men immune to hard work"".Read more:Your ultimate guide to the US electionHow Vance defends his 'childless cat ladies' remarksVladimir Putin reveals who he wants to win US electionIt was called ""one of the six best books to help understand Trump's win"", by The New York Times and given rave reviews by the likes of The Wall Street Journal and The Economist.But it also garnered plenty of criticism, with some - particularly across Appalachia - faulting it as a stereotypical and misleading portrait of the region and of poverty in the US, while ignoring the role of racism in politics.National talk shows and columnists - whether praising the book or finding fault with it - were giving it plenty of publicity.Memoir sells millionsThe book quickly hit best-seller lists and sold more than three million copies before Mr Trump chose him for the Republican ticket, according to its publishers HarperCollins.The memoir's sales were boosted in 2020 after it was made into a Netflix film directed by Ron Howard and starring Amy Adams as Mr Vance's mum Bev and Glenn Close as his grandmother.Mr Vance himself was played by Gabriel Basso, while Owen Asztalos played a younger version of him in flashbacks.And as Mr Vance moved away from capital ventures and into politics, his stock continued to rise.He became a popular political commentator on TV and announced he was running to become the state of Ohio's senator in 2022. He was subsequently elected and sworn into office in January 2023.Once a 'never Trumper'It's clear to see Mr Vance always understood the former president's appeal for voters.""He communicates in a way that is very relatable to a lot of people; it's one of the things that both parties frankly have been increasingly bad at, which is connecting to voters in an emotional and kind of visceral way, and I think Trump does that,"" he said in August 2016 - months before Mr Trump was elected.""And he is tapping into a substantive concern that people have... the sense America's best days are behind it and the future doesn't hold a whole lot of promise.""While he may have understood him, Mr Vance was actually highly critical of Mr Trump in 2016.He once described himself as a ""never Trumper"" and - after his election win - labelled the then-president an ""idiot"" and said he could be ""America's Hitler"".""I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole like Nixon who wouldn't be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he's America's Hitler,"" Mr Vance wrote privately to an associate on Facebook in 2016.When his Hitler comment was first reported, in 2022, a spokesperson did not dispute it, but said it no longer represented Vance's views.Vance's Trump U-turnMr Vance of course changed his mind.The book itself may have even played a big role in that process, as he is said to have grown close with Donald Trump Jr because he was a big fan of the memoir.The two became friends and by the time Mr Vance met Mr Trump in 2021, he had reversed his opinion, citing his accomplishments as president.By the time Mr Vance ran for the Senate in 2022 his demonstrations of loyalty - which included downplaying the January 6 Capitol riots - were sufficient to score Mr Trump's coveted endorsement.Mr Trump's support helped put him over the top in a competitive primary.In interviews Mr Vance has said there was no 'eureka' moment that changed his mind on Mr Trump.

The riverbank is of course the United States - so close you feel you can almost touch it.For these families wide-eyed with excitement, this is the moment they've dreamt of. Many have endured months, even years, on the road.All the latest US election updatesSometimes travelling thousands of miles through hostile countries, outwitting cartel gangs, and managing dizzyingly contradictory bureaucracy, all to get to this point: an asylum interview with United States border officials, and almost certain entry.On the migrant 'Train of Death': Electric shocks, beatings and brandingsOn its face, this all sounds like a system working in perfect harmony with the needy being helped by a welcoming country.But in reality, migration is a hotly disputed issue that is likely to dominate the Trump-Harris debate, and the run-up to the presidential election itself.You can watch live coverage of the debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump from midnight tonight on Sky News, on web and on mobileWho is ahead in the US election polls?Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsThe group I am with on the bridge is mostly from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Venezuela.They're claiming asylum, and with their paperwork and appointment email in hand, they approach the border with some trepidation but mostly with excitement and joy.Many have waited months for their appointment to come through after applying for asylum on the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) app.This group of a few hundred people on the bridge are now just a few steps from America.As they shuffle forward, CBP guards check their papers, make sure there are no errors, and wave them through to the other side for their case interviews.These families, these children, are about to start a new life.Along the border here in Matamoros, there's little sign of Donald Trump's border wall, but he'd doubtless approve of the razor wire fortifications on the American side of the Rio Grande.Experts here say there's no doubt who those seeking asylum are backing in this election and this debate - and that's Kamala Harris, who is seen to have a far less hostile approach to immigration.""I think the best would be a flexible US immigration policy again, like President Biden's when he began his administration,"" Oscar Misael Hernandez-Hernandez said as we chatted alongside the dozens of cars and trucks crossing the border.A professor of social anthropology at the El Colegio de la Frontera Norte research centre and an expert on Mexico-US border issues, he added: ""Biden broke with ultra-conservative vision and immigration policy.""So, I think if Harris implements a migration policy like this if she wins the presidency of the United States, it would be not only quite good for migrants in terms of human rights, but also quite good for international diplomacy, because the relations of the United States, at least with President Trump, if he wins, would be quite disastrous as they were in the past.""Read more:When is the US election?Terrifying risks Indians take to reach USIn shelters and hostels across Mexico, many other migrant families simply have to wait for their border appointments.It's like a lottery, and it can take a long time for their number to come up.Few leave the shelter; they would be easy prey for cartel gangs who would kidnap and hold them for ransom.Marlen Cabrera, 39, from Honduras, and her family are waiting it out along with 200 others at the Casa del Migrante San Francisco de Asis shelter.Any tightening of the immigration rules - as threatened by Donald Trump - would be a disaster for her.I asked her what she would do if the laws changed with a Trump victory.

""These actions will not be our last.""Protests for third consecutive nightMeanwhile large protests have continued for the third consecutive night in Tel Aviv, as many Israelis demand their government reach a deal to bring the hostages home.In the 7 October attack around 1,200 people were killed by Hamas and over 200 people taken hostage - triggering an invasion that has claimed over 40,000 Palestinian lives.One of Israel's stated key aims of this war has been to get the hostages home safe, but Mr Netanyahu has come under increasing criticism for his prolonged failure to do so - with many Israelis now holding him responsible for the hostage deaths.Read more:Hamas releases video of Israeli hostageIsraeli PM says he 'will not surrender'Govt defends timing of partial Israel arms banPhiladelphi corridor is sticking pointHundreds took to the streets on Tuesday night following threats of a general strike earlier this week.One key sticking point in ceasefire talks is Mr Netanyahu's insistence on Israeli control over the Gaza-Egypt border - in the form of the Philadelphi corridor.Benny Gantz, a former defence minister and military chief of staff, said Israel's focus should be on bringing the hostages home instead.He said Israel could return to the Philadelphi corridor if needed, describing it as an ""operational challenge, not an existential threat"".Read more on Sky News:Ukraine war latest: Putin blitzes city near border, killing sevenGrenfell fire latest: Final report to name and shame those responsibleFour of five children arrest for grandfather's 'murder' releasedKeep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsHe was joined in his criticism by another former military chief Gabi Eisenkot.They resigned from Mr Netanyahu's cabinet in June, accusing him of putting his own political survival ahead of the country's interests.",https://news.sky.com/story/uk-and-us-split-over-israel-after-british-government-suspends-some-arms-sales-13209320

13-02-2024,SkyNews,Israel-Hamas War,What is the two-state solution for Israel and Palestinians?,"The two-state solution has long been proposed as the best hope for peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.It would see an independent Palestinian state established alongside the existing one of Israel - giving both peoples their own territory.It is the official position of the UK, US, the United Nations, and until now, Israel.On 18 January in a televised address, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: ""In any future arrangement.... Israel needs security control over all territory west of the Jordan River.""It comes after several other Israeli politicians explicitly stated they no longer endorse a two-state solution.Here, we look at some of the key obstacles.What would it look like - and who would live where?The biggest obstacle to a two-state solution is deciding what the borders of a potential Palestinian state would be.Many believe they should be the same ones that existed before the 1967 Six-Day War, which saw Israel occupy East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza.Since then, increasing numbers of Israeli settlements have been established inside the West Bank, with around 600,000 Israelis now living there and in Occupied East Jerusalem.Although these settlements are considered illegal under international law, their existence makes the territory increasingly difficult to designate as Palestinian.Read more:The deep roots of the Israeli-Palestinian conflictCould Hezbollah-Israel clashes lead to a wider war?How did this war happen?The creation of Israel and the subsequent Arab-Israeli war of 1948 saw many Palestinians forced from their homes, in what is known as the Nakba, or ""catastrophe"" in English.As such, the UN gave around 750,000 people refugee status, defined as people ""whose normal place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948, and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict"".But under the same criteria, 5.9 million Palestinians - who live in the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, and in camps across Jordan, Lebanon and Syria - now qualify, and many would want to return to their homeland.There would not be space for this increased number of people inside the occupied territories, meaning some would have to be resettled in Israeli territory, which Israel is unlikely to tolerate.JerusalemThere are particular border difficulties with Jerusalem.Both sides claim the ancient city as their capital. This is because of its huge historical and religious significance for both Israelis and Palestinians and the fact it is home to several holy sites in Judaism, Islam, and Christianity.For example, the walled Old City hosts both The Temple Mount - Judaism's holiest site - and Al Aqsa Mosque, the third most important location in Islam behind Mecca and Medina, where Muslims believe the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven.In 2023, there were violent clashes between Israeli police and Palestinian worshippers there.The Israeli government claims Jerusalem is their ""undivided capital"", and it is the seat of the Israeli government and parliament (Knesset), but East Jerusalem is widely considered an occupied Palestinian territory.In theory, a two-state solution would officially recognise both East Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital and a western part of the city for the Israelis.Who supports it - and what has Israel said?Previously, Israel's endorsement was conditional on Palestinian groups demilitarising - as it sees Hamas and others as an existential threat.Fatah and the governing Palestinian Authority in the West Bank support the solution, providing they are allowed to police themselves.Hamas, which controls Gaza, has committed itself to the destruction of Israel. However, in a revised charter published in 2017, it said it would accept a Palestinian state along the 1967 borders.The lack of consensus on the Palestinian side makes the solution difficult - and the admission of Israeli officials that they are no longer committed to it near impossible.The US has recently reiterated the two-state solution is the best way to ensure Israel's security, unify moderate Arab countries in the region, and isolate Iran.It has also called for the Palestinian Authority to be ""revitalised"" and able to return to Gaza having been ousted in 2007.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerBut Mr Netanyahu said in his recent address that Israel ""will not settle for anything short of absolute victory"" and that Israeli control over all territory west of the Jordan River is a ""necessary condition"" when the current conflict ends.""I tell this truth to our American friends and I also stopped the attempt to impose a reality on us that would harm Israel's security,"" he said.Before now, he has been quoted by Israel's national broadcaster, saying Palestinian hopes of a sovereign state ""must be eliminated"".Previously Israeli communications minister Shlomo Karhi wrote on X: ""There will be no Palestinian state here.""And Israeli-UK ambassador Tzipi Hotovely told Sky News the country does ""absolutely not"" endorse a Palestinian state, adding: ""Israel knows today, and the world should know now that the Palestinians never wanted to have a state next to Israel.""They want to have a state from the river to the sea. They are saying it loud and clear. It's now two months after the war started. The Palestinian Authority didn't condemn this massacre (7 October). It's such a big problem.""Meanwhile, although the UN and international community have widely condemned the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and consider them a major barrier to peace, little has been done to deter Israel.Israel disagrees and cites historical and biblical ties to the land.It is widely considered to hold a power advantage over the Palestinians, economically and in terms of its military resources.It has benefited from the strong and consistent support of the US, from which it has been the largest cumulative recipient of US foreign aid since the Second World War.But that support has been on the basis that both sides were working towards a two-state solution, with many left wondering if that will now change.When was there more hope?Hope for the two-state solution peaked in the early 1990s, when the US facilitated the signing of the Oslo Accords under the presidency of Bill Clinton.Famously, then Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian Liberation Organisation chairman Yasser Arafat shook hands on the lawn of the White House.The Oslo Accords saw Israel formally acknowledge the PLO as representative of the Palestinians, and in return the group renounced violence.The two sides agreed on the formation of a Palestinian Authority, which would govern the West Bank and Gaza for a five-year period.Mr Rabin was assassinated by a young Jewish nationalist two years later, which many argue saw hopes of the two-state solution diminish.Since then, various factors have further reduced the chances of the two sides agreeing on a peaceful resolution.These include: increased Jewish settlements in the West Bank; Donald Trump's presidency and his relocation of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem; the most right-wing Israeli government in the country's history; and this year's Hamas attack and the ensuing war.",https://news.sky.com/story/israel-hamas-war-what-is-the-two-state-solution-12985473

And for good reason.There has been a sense building for months now among Israelis that something must give. The new forever war being waged in their name shows no end in sight and it is time for a reckoning.Middle East latest: General strike called in Israel as pressure grows on NetanyahuThere is a consensus forming among Israel's commentators and opinion formers across the political spectrum that the obstacle to a deal bringing home the hostages is the prime minister.It is no longer just those observers on the left blaming him. The ceasefire deal being pushed by the US is on life support because Mr Netanyahu shifted his position at the 11th hour of negotiations and made new demands.His own senior negotiators were so frustrated by his vacillation they leaked evidence of it to the press.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsHamas have played fast and loose too, not least sending a suicide bomber to Tel Aviv at the height of negotiations.But diplomats close to the negotiations say there is little doubt that were it not for Mr Netanyahu's tactics an agreement would have been made and the hostages, or many of them, would be coming home.Read more:Satellite evidence suggests Israel is building long-term presence in GazaHamas commander killed in West Bank, Israeli military saysPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerA reckoning is of course coming. It is just a question of time. And Mr Netanyahu knows that any ceasefire deal brings that moment closer.What follows could lay bare his failures as leader before 7 October and since.A sense of that came from Yair Lapid, the Israeli opposition leader, who last week claimed there were ""repeated strategic warnings of an eruption of violence and the loss of deterrence"" before 7 October.There is also a sense of failure and loss of confidence among Israelis, which is profoundly shocking to outsiders who know them well.As one veteran Israeli observer put it to me recently, whatever their crises, Israelis have always believed in the end they would bounce back and prevail. But now they are not sure. That is a fundamental break with the past and it is deeply unnerving.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeIt is essential for the national psyche for Israelis to move on. But they will only recover their chutzpah when they establish what went wrong.Central to that process will be the way they handle the leader at the centre of it all, Mr Netanyahu.The prime minister has pressing political reasons not to sign a ceasefire deal. It could torpedo his government. His far-right extremist coalition partners might walk.But those who know the prime minister say there's more than that at play. He is worried about his legacy and clings to the hope he can still claw victory from the quagmire in Gaza.He sees himself as an Israeli Churchill and anything short of the total victory he promised is not acceptable, however deluded that seems.Six months ago Joe Biden warned that Mr Netanyahu was ""hurting Israel"" more than helping it.More and more Israelis believe their prime minister is delaying the inevitable for no reason but his own political survival and that selfishness is now costing lives.That cannot go on indefinitely.

It reaches from Gaza's border with Israel to the edge of the town of Beit Hanoun.The IDF has bulldozed farmland, orchards and buildings to create the corridor, which allows the IDF some freedom of movement while denying Gazans access to their homes, many of which no longer exist.Analysts from Forensic Architecture, which have put together the findings, believe it is part of a long-term strategy.""This is alarming because in the history of Israel's occupation corridors were used to fragment Palestinian territories, particularly in the West Bank,"" says Samaneh Moafi.""Corridors are actually well-honed colonial techniques of fragmentation and separation. And lastly, what these corridors are doing, is that they will be preventing access, preventing return [of residents].""Israel already has control of two strategic 'corridors' in Gaza: the Netzarim passage bisects the Strip from east to west cutting off northern Gaza from the south, and Israeli forces have occupied the Philadelphi Corridor since May. The Philadelphi runs nine miles along the southern Gaza border with Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea.For years, Hamas used tunnels into the Egyptian Sinai to smuggle goods and weapons into Gaza.'Military strategy is to prevent Hamas re-arming itself'Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly refused to withdraw Israeli forces from the corridor, fearing Hamas will try and rearm through that route. Hamas has insisted the IDF pulls back.""The military strategy here is to prevent Hamas re-arming itself and rebuilding its military power,"" explained former Israeli intelligence officer Avi Melamed.""In that regard, particularly the Philadelphi pass and the Rafah crossing are the most significant critical element: firstly because the fact that Hamas basically either through the tunnels under the Philadelphi road or through Rafah crossing itself, basically was streaming huge amounts of weapons and ammunition to the Gaza Strip.""Additionally, Mr Netanyahu wants to keep Israeli forces along the Netzarim corridor to prevent Hamas fighters from moving within Gaza.'I see Israel acting freely inside the Gaza Strip'The ongoing presence of the IDF in these areas is one of the main reasons a ceasefire is yet to be agreed.""What Hamas have been able to do is to move their terror troops from the north to the south to the different neighbourhoods and if you don't sever the north from the south then you cannot really blow up in a very systematic way that subterranean arena,"" assesses former IDF Colonel Miri Eisin.""As it is right now, I see Israel acting freely inside the Gaza Strip unless there is a real force that can work instead to stop the terror capabilities.""Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerRead more:Hamas commander killed in West Bank, Israeli military saysIsrael and Hamas agree brief ceasefires to distribute polio vaccineFive killed inside mosque, IDF saysIsrael could try to keep military presence in Gaza over long periodOn Thursday evening, the Israeli Security Cabinet voted in favour of keeping IDF troops in the Philadelphi Corridor, despite some Israeli security officials advising the prime minister a partial withdrawal could be managed.One theory a number of security veterans have suggested to Sky News is that Israel will try and keep a military presence in Gaza over a long period - some predict months, while others think it could be years.The working assumption is the IDF would use these positions as staging posts to effectively fight a counter-insurgency, carrying out operations within Gaza as and when deemed necessary, similar to the way the IDF operates in Palestinian-controlled urban areas of the West Bank.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsIsrael pushed to present 'day-after' planCeasefire talks have continued in Cairo and Doha this week, with lower-level mediators in attendance.

Ambulances continually drove past us, in both directions.The ones trying to reach Jenin's main hospital were stopped and searched to check they were transporting wanted militants. Many were refused access.It felt quieter than previous IDF raids I've covered in Jenin. There were a few bursts of gunfire, and a drone circling constantly overhead, but otherwise pretty quiet.That could be misleading. Israeli military officials tell me the operation could last a while longer yet and spread to other towns in the West Bank.Israel says it is determined to smash terrorist cells operating there, but they've been carrying out raids, almost constantly, and still find the need to do so.The underlying issues are much deeper and more complex - more civilian bodies could only make an already dire situation worse.Images from a morgue in Tubas show a number of dead from the latest West Bank attacks as it appeared the Israeli military was operating in a number of cities in the territory.The armed wings of Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and Fatah said in separate statements their gunmen were fighting Israeli forces in the three West Bank areas.Clashes with the Israeli military in the West Bank have risen sharply since the 7 October attacks and subsequent invasion of Gaza, while Israeli settlers have also launched frequent vigilante-style attacks on Palestinian communities.Israel described the overnight operation as a ""counter-terrorism"" strike, and posting on X, minister for foreign affairs Israel Katz said: ""The IDF has been operating with intensity since last night in the refugee camps of Jenin and Tulkarm to thwart Islamic-Iranian terrorist infrastructures that have been established there.""He accused Iran of working to set up an ""eastern terrorist front"".Mr Katz added: ""This is a full-fledged war, and we must win it.""Five killed in Monday airstrikeSeparately, the IDF said it had ""eliminated five terrorists"" operating in the area of Nur Shams, also in the West Bank, on Monday.Among those dead, they named Jibril Jasan Ismail, who they said was released as part of ""the agreement in November 2023"" - the same time Israel and Hamas conducted a large-scale hostage swap.""Also eliminated were the terrorists Mohanad Qarawi and Muhammad Yussef ... and the terrorist Adnan Jaber,"" the IDF added.Thousands of Palestinians have been arrested in recent military raids in the West Bank, and at least 637 have been killed since the 7 October attacks, according to Palestinian health ministry figures.Many of them are armed fighters but others are stone-throwing youths or uninvolved civilians.At least 30 Israelis have been killed in attacks in Jerusalem and the West Bank during the same period, according to Israeli tallies.Middle East correspondentThe IDF launched its latest military assault overnight in the West Bank on Tuesday. It is focused on the towns of Tulkarm and Jenin although other operations are ongoing elsewhere in the West Bank.Israeli officials say they are acting against attempts by Iran to smuggle weapons and explosives into the West Bank and encourage terror attacks against Israelis.The raids are not targeted at any specific militant group, although elements of Hamas and Islamic Jihad are one focus.The IDF has used drones to strike targets and there are reports of helicopter gunships circling above Jenin. Roads in and out have been shut off and access to hospitals is blocked.Violence in the West Bank, both attacks against Israelis but also IDF raids, has been on the rise since the start of 2023 and has increased further since 7 October.Israel says more than 150 attacks have originated from the West Bank in the past eleven months.A failed suicide bomb in Tel Aviv two weeks ago, which killed the attacker when it exploded in his rucksack and injured one other, is a dangerous development and has caused extreme concern in security circles.It's unclear how long this operation will last, the IDF is not putting a duration on it, nor are they saying how many soldiers are involved.

11-09-2024,SkyNews,US,Where did Donald Trump's pet-eating claims come from?,"Donald Trump has repeated claims that immigrants in an Ohio town are eating the pets of other residents.The claims were immediately fact-checked by the moderators during last night's presidential debate between Mr Trump and Kamala Harris.But what exactly did Mr Trump say and where have the claims come from?What Trump said during debateThe presidential hopeful said in the first head-to-head with his opponent: ""In Springfield, they're eating the dogs, the people that came in, they're eating the cats  They're eating... they're eating the pets of the people that live there.""And this is what's happening in our country, and it's a shame.""Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsWhen ABC's debate moderator David Muir responded saying they had reached out to the city manager who disputed the claims, Mr Trump said: ""I've seen people on television  the people on television say 'my dog was taken and used for food', so maybe he said that and maybe that's a good thing to say for a city manager.""Ms Harris, who could be seen laughing and saying ""this is unbelievable"", responded when it was her turn: ""Talk about extreme.""JD Vance backs Trump's commentsMr Trump's running mate JD Vance, who had already tweeted about the claims on Monday, defended the Republican presidential candidate's comments after the debate, saying: ""No one has spread false claims.""Mr Vance, who is a senator for Ohio, added the Haitian community had ""caused a lot of problems"" in the area.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player""It's led to animals disappearing,"" he said. ""Many of my constituents have said that has been happening.""The city manager said there's no verifiable evidence. A lot of residents on the ground have said there is. That just means the city manager, I think, isn't in touch with what's going on on the ground there.""He went on to reiterate he'd spoken to residents who had seen geese being taken out of local ponds and slaughtered.Where do the claims come from?They seemingly originated from a local resident who complained about Haitian immigrants at a Springfield city commission meeting on 27 August.The man, who said he was a social media influencer, urged the government to ""do something"", making unsubstantiated claims about supposed crimes they were committing.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerHe said they were capturing ducks in a local park, slaughtering them and eating them.Facebook posts on local crime-watch groups started making similar claims, with one supposed resident whose post went viral saying their ""daughter's friend"" had seen Haitians eating her cat and that local authorities had said they were doing the same with ducks and geese.What are the facts?The Springfield Police Division said in a statement that they were aware of the ""rumours"" and had no information to support them.""In response to recent rumours alleging criminal activity by the immigrant population in our city, we wish to clarify that there have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community,"" the police said.Read more:Trump v Harris debate: What were the key points?Analysis: Trump faces new challenges in HarrisThousands of temporary Haitian migrants have landed in the city in recent years, as longstanding unrest in their home country has given way to violent gangs ruling the streets, and their arrival has been contentious in local communities.Sky News US correspondent Mark Stone said: ""This is, as far as we're aware, an utterly baseless claim,"" adding Mr Trump had ""latched onto a conspiracy theory"" and is ""running with it"".Springfield Mayor Rob Rue also said on Tuesday there were no documented cases of immigrants eating pets.Speaking at a meeting of the city commission, Mr Rue said: ""Rumours like these are taking away from the real issues such as housing concerns, resources needed for our schools and our overwhelmed health care system.""Mr Rue also explained that one alleged case of someone attacking a cat - falsely attributed to a Haitian immigrant in Springfield - occurred in Canton, Ohio, some 160 miles away, Sky News' US partner NBC News reported. The defendant in that case, charged with animal cruelty, has no known connection to Haiti, according to The Canton Repository newspaper.Had Trump made the claims before?Not directly, but Republicans including Mr Vance had stoked the rumours ahead of the debate.The official X account for the Republicans on the House judiciary committee posted an AI-generated image of Mr Trump with his arms around a duck and cat with the caption: ""Protect our ducks and kittens in Ohio!""Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeTed Cruz, the Republican senator from Texas, shared a photo of two cats hugging with the caption: ""Please vote for Trump so Haitian immigrants don't eat us.""On Monday Mr Vance tweeted saying: ""In the last several weeks, my office has received many inquiries from actual residents of Springfield who've said their neighbours' pets or local wildlife were abducted by Haitian migrants.""It's possible, of course, that all of these rumours will turn out to be false.""",https://news.sky.com/story/where-did-donald-trumps-pet-eating-claims-come-from-13212808
10-09-2024,SkyNews,US,Kamala Harris: The high school conversation that drove her to where she is today,"Kamala Harris was a prosecutor for far longer than she's been a politician.Harris's lengthy career in law started in 1990 when she became a deputy district attorney specialising in prosecuting child sexual assault offenders.It ran until 2017 when she was overseeing the largest state justice department in the country as attorney general of California.She says what drove her - and what still drives her - is ""a very strong sense of responsibility to protect those who are vulnerable"".But where did that sense of responsibility come from?According to her, the catalyst was a devastating situation with her best friend at high school.Ms Harris, who was raised in Berkeley in California, moved to Montreal in Canada for high school with her mother Shyamala Gopalan and sister Maya after Ms Gopalan, a breast cancer scientist, got a research job there.Trump v Harris: How body language spoke as loudly as the wordsWhere did Donald Trump's pet-eating claims come from?Aggression, disrespect and insult - a confrontation that Trump has rarely facedIt was at West Mount High School where she met fellow student Wanda Kagan, who was also new.The pair quickly became best friends. But as they grew closer, Ms Harris could sense something was off.She first spoke about the incident in a video uploaded to her social media in 2020, with permission from Ms Kagan.""I suspected something, because she would come to school and just be sad,"" Ms Harris said in a video.""And there were times when she just didn't seem to want to go home.""And I remember asking her: 'Is everything ok?' I just sensed it.""Her best friend then told her she was being sexually and physically abused by her stepfather.""And so I said to her as soon as she told me: 'Well, you have to come stay with us,'"" Ms Harris said.""And a big part of the reason I wanted to be a prosecutor was to protect people like her.""Ms Gopalan took the teenager in and helped her navigate the system to get the support she needed, Ms Kagan told Sky News in 2020.Expanding on her experiences last month, Ms Kagan told MSNBC Ms Harris ""rescued"" her and that she, along with her family, gave her ""stability and structured me into believing I could continue my education"".Ms Kagan, who still lives in Montreal and went on to have a career in healthcare, said it's been an ""emotional ride"" to watch Ms Harris go on to ""fight for the American people just like she fought for me over 40 years ago"".""I want them [voters] to see that she's exactly the kind of person that she's always been from over 40 years ago in high school when she rescued me and it wasn't just 'say something' - it was 'do something'.""She was going to make sure that something was done and to advocate for me even after I went to live with her and her mum and Maya.""She has those protective instincts.

But years later, when she was a prosecutor, Ms Harris called Ms Kagan and told her the impact of going through those experiences with her had led her to fight for children and women who had been sexually assaulted.""That was a really special, touching moment when she shared the impact that I had on her life,"" Ms Kagan said. ""I know she's always had an impact on my life and where I am today.""How Harris got hereAfter finishing high school, she went on to graduate from Howard University and then the University of California Hastings College of Law, which she graduated from in 1989.The following year she became deputy prosecutor in Alameda County in California, specialising in prosecuting child sexual assault cases, but also working on homicide and robbery cases.She worked there until 1998 when she was made managing attorney of a criminal unit at the San Francisco District Attorney's Office before becoming head of the San Francisco City Attorney's Division on Families and Children.She became the first female district attorney for San Francisco in 2004. During her first three years in the position, the conviction rate in the city jumped from 52% to 67%.She served for six years before being elected as attorney general of California in 2010, where she oversaw the largest state justice department in the country.In 2016, she won the US Senate race in California, beating fellow Democrat Loretta Sanchez who had 20 years' experience in Congress.Here, she built a reputation around her work as a prosecutor and gained national attention during her forensic questioning of Trump administration officials including Jeff Sessions, and then Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.She had become a prominent politician by the time she launched a campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in January 2019, going with the slogan ""Kamala Harris for the People"".Democrats saw her as a promising candidate to overthrow Donald Trump's presidency in the 2020 election, but Ms Harris ultimately dropped out of the race in December 2019, blaming a lack of finances.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeJoe Biden selected her as his running mate in August 2021, describing her as a ""fearless fighter for the little guy"".It made her the first black female running mate for the two major parties, and only the third female running mate for the two major parties in American history.Fast-forward around three years and President Joe Biden, who was struggling in the aftermath of a disastrous debate against Mr Trump, opted to bow out of the 2024 election and endorse his vice president for his position.

three times the speed of sound).The missiles connect to satellites after being launched so they can hit targets at a speed of Mach 4 (3,069mph).It is believed the Iranians are using the Russian's GLONASS satellite navigation system, which provides an alternative to GPS.British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the supply of ballistic missiles from Iran to Russia was ""definitely a significant escalation"" and said the UK was ""coordinating"".However, when asked if he would approve Ukraine's use of the Storm Shadow long-range missiles to strike targets inside Russia, Mr Lammy said he would not comment on ""operational issues"".The US will be announcing further sanctions on Iran later on Tuesday, Mr Blinken said, including further measures against Iran Air.He said other countries were also expected to announce fresh sanctions.Security and Defence EditorIran's decision to send ballistic missiles to Russia as its two-year invasion of Ukraine rages on has been branded as a ""significant escalation"" by UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy.It is a serious step-up in what is already a significant level of military assistance given by Iran to its ally, which until now had comprised attack drones, ammunition and artillery shells -

10-09-2024,SkyNews,US,Tim Walz: The arrest that changed his life - and how it shaped his political career,"""You have responsibilities to others. You can't afford to make foolish decisions.""Those are the words Tim Walz's wife Gwen said to him after he was arrested for drink-driving at the age of 31.Now Kamala Harris's vice president nominee, Mr Walz looks back on this as a defining incident in his life, describing it as a ""life-changing"" moment.Mr Walz, now 60 and running to be the Democratic vice president, offered to resign from his teaching job and permanently swapped alcohol for Diet Mountain Dew, he told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis while running for governor of Minnesota in 2018.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player23 September 1995Tim Walz was working as a geography teacher and football coach at a high school in Nebraska when he was stopped by police on 23 September 1995.He had not long got his teaching degree and met his wife of a year Gwen, who was also a teacher from Minnesota.He had been watching college football with some friends when he was pulled over going 96mph in a 55mph zone.According to court documents, the state police officer smelled alcohol on his breath and Mr Walz failed initial breath tests.He was taken to a nearby hospital for a blood test and booked into Dawes County Jail.Court documents show he had 0.128% alcohol in his blood, which was over the legal limit of 0.1%.His lawyer claimed Mr Walz initially thought the police car was chasing him because it came up so quickly behind him and didn't turn its lights on.Ultimately Mr Walz took a plea deal and the charge was reduced to reckless driving. He lost his licence and was fined $200 ( 152).'Real disappointed in himself'When the case came to court in March 1996, Mr Walz's defence lawyer said that as a high school teacher and role model to his students, he felt ""terrible"" and was ""real disappointed, I guess, in himself"".The arrest saw him give up his coaching position - and even offer his resignation to his principal because he ""felt so bad"".His boss convinced him to stay, however, so instead Mr Walz used the experience to warn his pupils of the dangers of drink-driving.He told the courtroom: ""It's just a dangerous situation. Not just to myself, but to others who aren't even involved with it.""Tim Walz's drink-driving arrest re-emerged in the media soon after Kamala Harris announced he was going to be her running mate this year.But there was some confusion over false claims he wasn't over the limit.When he was running for Congress in 2006, his campaign spokesperson told a local news outlet in Minnesota he was not drunk that night in 1995.She said of the decision to reduce the charge to reckless driving: ""The DUI charge was dropped for a reason: It wasn't true.""She claimed that hearing loss he suffered while with his National Guard artillery unit may have been the reason he failed sobriety tests.There were also false reports given by his team that he had been allowed to drive himself to the police station   where he was later allowed to leave of his own accord.Court documents have since shown no mention of any hearing issues   and that he was driven to Dawes County Jail by officers.Speaking to his local newspaper in the run-up to his 2018 election as governor, Mr Walz reflected on how his run-in with the law changed his perspective.His father, a school administrator, died when he was 19.In an interview, he said it left him feeling as though his life had been ""ripped up"" and, throwing caution to the wind, saw him take unnecessary risks.He had joined the National Guard two years before, but instead of pursuing a military career, he went to China. It was only the second time ever he had got on a plane. He spent a year teaching there, which coincided with the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.On his return to the US he moved from state to state - Nebraska to Texas to Arkansas - where he ended up working in a factory that made beds for tanning salons.Bridging dividesHe returned to Nebraska, took up his first US teaching post and a full-time job with the National Guard, with football coaching on the side.Before long he started dating his wife, whom he married in 1994. They have two children - daughter Hope who was born in 2001 and son Gus born in 2006.After the couple moved back to Minnesota, Mr Walz swapped the National Guard, where he had progressed to command sergeant major by the time he left in 2005, with politics.That year he ran for Congress in the Republican-leaning 1st district of Minnesota.Read moreWho is Tim Walz?Walz accused of lying about fertility treatmentAnalysis: Why Harris picked WalzDuring the campaign, he established himself as someone who could build bridges - in a traditionally Democrat state surrounded by the Republican rural heartlands of Wisconsin and Michigan.He gave an example of when he was still a teacher in 1999 - and one of his pupils wanted to start a gay-straight alliance - just three years after President Bill Clinton had signed the Defence of Marriage Act, effectively banning same-sex marriage.In his National Guard days, he had seen LGBT people threatened with discharge, and at school, pupils bullied by their peers for their sexuality.Seeing the potential to cut through to its critics, Mr Walz became the group's faculty adviser.He told a newspaper interview: ""It really needed to be the football coach, who was the soldier and was straight and was married.""After beating the Republican incumbent to take his House seat in 2007, he stayed there for 12 years, before successfully running for governor in 2018.When Kamala Harris announced him as her VP pick this year, she said: ""As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he's delivered for working families like his.""",https://news.sky.com/story/tim-walz-the-arrest-that-changed-his-life-and-how-it-shaped-his-political-career-13208883
10-09-2024,SkyNews,US,JD Vance: How vice-presidential candidate used his 'hillbilly' background to catapult himself to the top of US politics,"When JD Vance says he came from nothing, he really means it.There are plenty of clich s that seemingly encapsulate how a child born in poverty can go on to become a vice presidential candidate by the age of 39; it's almost the perfect example of the ""American Dream"".But Donald Trump's running mate isn't in this position in spite of his challenging upbringing - in many ways, he's there because of it.This is how JD Vance took his experiences as a self-proclaimed hillbilly and used them to write a bestselling book and propel himself to the top of politics.Hillbilly ElegyIn his 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy, Mr Vance, born into an impoverished household in southern Ohio, shares stories about his chaotic family life and about communities that had declined and seemed to lose hope.He details his own journey and how he navigated his dysfunctional family.Trump v Harris: How body language spoke as loudly as the wordsWhere did Donald Trump's pet-eating claims come from?Aggression, disrespect and insult - a confrontation that Trump has rarely facedThere's his grandmother, who he refers to as Mamaw, who helped raise him on ""tough love"" - and once doused his Papaw with gasoline and dropped a lit match to punish him for being unfaithful. He escaped with minor burns.Then there is his mother, who struggled to care for him as she battled a drug addiction and at one point forced him to provide a urine sample for her drug test.He analyses his experiences growing up in Ohio to reflect on why the working-class American region of Appalachia, which consists of 13 states from southern New York to northern Mississippi, changed from reliably Democratic to reliably Republican.He does this not just by looking at his family, but also at the troubled community around him. He highlights the impact the steel industry's struggles in the 1970s had on his city, along with the opioid crisis which plagued the country.""It is in Greater Appalachia where the fortunes of working-class whites seem dimmest. From low social mobility to poverty to divorce and drug addiction, my home is a hub of misery,"" he writes in the introduction.He goes on to say he identifies with the ""millions of working-class Americans who have no college degree"".""To these folks, poverty is the family tradition - their ancestors were day labourers in the southern slave economy, share-croppers after that, and machinists and millworkers during more recent times.""Americans call them hillbillies, rednecks or white trash. I call them neighbours, friends and family.""The book was written by Mr Vance in his late 20s/early 30s. By that point, he had gone on to serve in the Marine Corps, graduate from Yale Law School where he met his wife Usha, and become a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley.Critical acclaim - and some critiquesTo many liberal Americans struggling to understand why a wealthy New York businessman like Donald Trump was appealing to so many struggling working-class voters in the 2016 US election, the book was something of a revelation.And conservatives were also widely keen on the book, which criticised the welfare system and what Vance saw as ""too many young men immune to hard work"".Read more:Your ultimate guide to the US electionHow Vance defends his 'childless cat ladies' remarksVladimir Putin reveals who he wants to win US electionIt was called ""one of the six best books to help understand Trump's win"", by The New York Times and given rave reviews by the likes of The Wall Street Journal and The Economist.But it also garnered plenty of criticism, with some - particularly across Appalachia - faulting it as a stereotypical and misleading portrait of the region and of poverty in the US, while ignoring the role of racism in politics.National talk shows and columnists - whether praising the book or finding fault with it - were giving it plenty of publicity.Memoir sells millionsThe book quickly hit best-seller lists and sold more than three million copies before Mr Trump chose him for the Republican ticket, according to its publishers HarperCollins.The memoir's sales were boosted in 2020 after it was made into a Netflix film directed by Ron Howard and starring Amy Adams as Mr Vance's mum Bev and Glenn Close as his grandmother.Mr Vance himself was played by Gabriel Basso, while Owen Asztalos played a younger version of him in flashbacks.And as Mr Vance moved away from capital ventures and into politics, his stock continued to rise.He became a popular political commentator on TV and announced he was running to become the state of Ohio's senator in 2022. He was subsequently elected and sworn into office in January 2023.Once a 'never Trumper'It's clear to see Mr Vance always understood the former president's appeal for voters.""He communicates in a way that is very relatable to a lot of people; it's one of the things that both parties frankly have been increasingly bad at, which is connecting to voters in an emotional and kind of visceral way, and I think Trump does that,"" he said in August 2016 - months before Mr Trump was elected.""And he is tapping into a substantive concern that people have... the sense America's best days are behind it and the future doesn't hold a whole lot of promise.""While he may have understood him, Mr Vance was actually highly critical of Mr Trump in 2016.He once described himself as a ""never Trumper"" and - after his election win - labelled the then-president an ""idiot"" and said he could be ""America's Hitler"".""I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole like Nixon who wouldn't be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he's America's Hitler,"" Mr Vance wrote privately to an associate on Facebook in 2016.When his Hitler comment was first reported, in 2022, a spokesperson did not dispute it, but said it no longer represented Vance's views.Vance's Trump U-turnMr Vance of course changed his mind.The book itself may have even played a big role in that process, as he is said to have grown close with Donald Trump Jr because he was a big fan of the memoir.The two became friends and by the time Mr Vance met Mr Trump in 2021, he had reversed his opinion, citing his accomplishments as president.By the time Mr Vance ran for the Senate in 2022 his demonstrations of loyalty - which included downplaying the January 6 Capitol riots - were sufficient to score Mr Trump's coveted endorsement.Mr Trump's support helped put him over the top in a competitive primary.In interviews Mr Vance has said there was no 'eureka' moment that changed his mind on Mr Trump. Instead, he claimed to have gradually realised that his opposition to Mr Trump was rooted in style over substance.Some have criticised him for the shift as he continues to distance himself from some of his old comments. Not only that - but from his memoir.He recently told The New York Times he had distanced himself from Hillbilly Elegy in order not to ""wake up in 10 years and really hate everything that I've become.""Fast-forward to now and Mr Vance is campaigning alongside Mr Trump ahead of what promises to be a dramatic election day on 5 November.His memoir sales will be in Mr Vance's peripheral at this late stage in the race - but it's worth noting more than 650,000 copies were bought in the 10 days after Mr Trump announced him as running mate.",https://news.sky.com/story/jd-vance-how-vice-presidential-candidate-used-his-hillbilly-background-to-catapult-himself-to-the-top-of-us-politics-13210612

a lightweight semi-automatic rifle often associated with school shootings.On Friday a judge ruled that the teenager would not face the death penalty because, as a juvenile, the maximum sentence he can receive is life without parole.Suspect's mother 'called the school 30 minutes before attack'Gray's aunt has claimed his mother called one of the high school's counsellors warning of an ""extreme emergency"" 30 minutes before he allegedly opened fire there.Annie Brown, the teenager's aunt, told the Washington Post the boy's mother also said they needed to find Gray ""immediately"".Phone records shared with the newspaper, and later confirmed by the Associated Press, show a 10-minute call was made from the family's shared phone plan to the school at that time.Gray had been investigated beforeGray was investigated by police over threats to carry out a similar attack last year, the FBI said in a statement on Wednesday.They said they received several anonymous tips about Gray telling people on the gaming platform Discord that he might carry out a shooting.The FBI interviewed Gray, then 13, who denied making the threats, and his father, who stated he had hunting guns locked in a safe in the family home but that his son did not have unsupervised access to them.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerHe said the teenager had struggled with his parents' separation and often got picked on at school.""He knows the seriousness of weapons and what they can do, and how to use them and not use them,"" the boy's father said, according to a transcript of the interview.He also mentioned his son becoming ""flustered under pressure"" and ""not really thinking straight"".""I don't want him to fight anybody, but they just keep like pinching him and touching him,"" he told investigators in May 2023.Ultimately the case was closed after neither Colt nor Colin Gray were successfully linked to the Discord account the threats were made from.There were no grounds to confiscate the family's guns either, according to police reports released by the sheriff's office.Authorities are now re-investigating the incident and any possible connection it may have to the most recent shooting.After speaking about the FBI statement, Mr Hosey said: ""We are also aware of some previous contacts that the Department of Family and Children Services had had with the suspect and his family, and we are pursuing that avenue as well.""Law enforcement sources have told NBC News Colin Gray bought his son an AR-style rifle as a gift after the pair were questioned.What we know about the victimsThe four victims who died have been named as students Mason Schermerhorn and Christian Angulo, both 14, and teachers Richard Aspenwall, 39, and Christina Irimie, 53.Christian was described as ""a very good kid and very sweet and so caring"" by his older sister, Lisette Angulo.""He was so loved by many. His loss was so sudden and unexpected. We are truly heartbroken. He really didn't deserve this,"" she added.Mr Aspenwall and Ms Irimie both taught maths, according to the school's website, with the former also listed as a defensive coordinator for the football team.Read more:Boy, 8, fatally shoots himself with mother's gunFour people shot dead 'execution-style' on trainNine other people, eight students and one teacher, were injured in the attack.

""I don't want to meet the Lord that way.""Student Jacob King said he had dozed off in his world history class after morning football practice when he heard around 10 gunshots.He said he did not believe the shooting was real until he heard an officer yelling at someone to put down their gun. He said that when his class was led out, he saw officers shielding what appeared to be an injured student.Ashley Enoh said she was at home on Wednesday morning when she got a text from her brother, who is a senior at the school.The message said: ""Just so you know, I love you.""When she asked in the family group chat what was going on, he said there was a gunman at the school.Shirley Power spoke to Sky News' US partner NBC News about learning of the shooting at her grandchild's school from her daughter.""My daughter called me at work screaming that there was a shooter at Apalachee and begged me to get there as quick as possible,"" Ms Powers said.She said the principal instructed her grandson to run to the band room.""Start praying, for all the kids, not just my grandson,"" she added.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerAuthorities were alerted to the attack due to a new alarm system that had only been implemented a week earlier.Sheriff Jud Smith said: ""All of our teachers are armed with a form of ID, this alarms us and alerts law enforcement officers after buttons are pressed on the ID.""It alerts us there is an active situation at the school.

09-09-2024,SkyNews,US,"Three key challenges for Kamala Harris: Biden's shadow, Trump's 'comrade' attacks and her interview problem ","Donald Trump and Kamala Harris face intense scrutiny in the remaining two months of the US election campaign.Ever since Ms Harris became the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee with Joe Biden's historic announcement he would not seek re-election, she has enjoyed a rapid ascent in polling.But momentum can swing quickly in an election campaign, and issues persist for both candidates - which could be crucial at their first debate on Tuesday.Read more:Your ultimate guide to the US electionThe challenges facing TrumpA recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College puts the former president one point ahead of the vice president, at 48% to 47% respectively.With only weeks to go until America goes to the polls, here's a look at three key challenges for the Democratic nominee...Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeRepublicans portray Kamala Harris as a California liberal of the hard left, a ""radical left lunatic"" as Donald Trump would have it.They point to her 'flip-flopping' on key policy areas and insist it exposes an extreme left agenda, while raising questions of authenticity and trust.In her effort to win the Democratic nomination in 2020, Harris took a left-leaning stance on several issues as she paid heed to her party's progressive wing. That has changed with her political elevation.As vice president, she duly aligned herself more centrally with the administration of the day and so modified her position on issues.On fracking - she favoured a ban, now doesn't; for healthcare, she backed a scheme to eliminate private insurance, now doesn't; on illegal border crossings, she supported decriminalisation, and now doesn't.In a recent interview, Harris addressed her shift by saying her values hadn't changed and her time as VP had given her a fresh perspective.Her opponents will insist she has chosen convenience over conviction in a cynical bid to hoodwink independent, moderate voters.There's a reason Joe Biden was struggling in the polls - his age didn't help, of course, but neither did his record.On a matter most important - the economy - he can cite improvement, having delivered on GDP, unemployment and inflation.His difficulty is in the economic indicators more measurable and meaningful to the public - prices at the petrol pumps and in the shops - that have left Americans feeling the pinch and feeling less well off than they were four years ago.Inflation may be falling, but prices are roughly 20% higher than they were during the COVID pandemic. As hard as the president has tried to sell ""Bidenomics,"" the voters aren't buying.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerIn her effort to escape the shadow of economic angst, Harris has unveiled proposals she says will cut costs and is punting a populist line that casts big business and greedy landlords as the villains making life difficult.Departing from Biden's big picture boasting about economic wins and legislative victories, she aims to talk money in terms the voter understands and to empathise with their concerns.The strategy needs to work for her. A CNBC survey in August found 40% of voters said they'd be better off financially under a Trump presidency compared to 21% if Harris won.Harris's opponents say that, as a core member of the existing government, she bears responsibility for the public's financial woes.They insist she will also have to answer for the record of the Biden administration as a whole - expect her to face awkward questions, too, on subjects like Afghanistan and the Israel/Hamas conflict.Read more:Will Starmer meet with Harris and Trump?Five things we learnt in Harris's DNC speechKeep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsKamala Harris can work a crowd.At the Democratic National Convention and at rallies across the country, she has demonstrated a stage presence and sure-footedness that energises the faithful.

Even then, it was with running mate Tim Walz by her side.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerThat's one set-piece - or joint - interview in six weeks.It would be an astonishing lack of independent scrutiny for someone bidding to be a local parish councillor, let alone president of the United States.There remain questions unasked of Kamala Harris and the apparent reluctance to address them creates a sense of vulnerability.The enthusiasm for a change in the ticket has shored up the Democratic vote, no doubt, but Harris needs to extend her reach to the undecideds, independents and Republicans feeling reluctant about Trump.They need to know who she is and what she stands for. Harris has come a distance in the polls but they are starting to look sticky.She needs the extra votes. If the TV interview is a risk, it's one she might have to take - more than once every six weeks.It's one thing rolling out the teleprompted hits to the adoring masses, it's quite another sitting down for independent interrogation.That, perhaps more than elsewhere, is where judgement lies.",https://news.sky.com/story/three-key-challenges-for-kamala-harris-bidens-shadow-trumps-comrade-attacks-and-her-interview-problem-13211760

Such is the draw of Donald Trump in places like this.I'm back in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, a town I've been to a few times over the past eight years.I was first here in 2016, on the night when Donald Trump dramatically defeated Hillary Clinton - the election which propelled him to the White House. I returned four years later when Trump lost to Joe Biden.This is a rust belt town which feels now to be rusting away.It's one of those neglected places in America, a town bypassed by highways and forgotten by people who live a better life somewhere else.The thriving steel industry on which Johnstown was built is long gone. The vast metal plant which once dominated the town centre now employs just a fraction of the workers. Young people who see opportunity elsewhere leave as soon as they can.Main Street is now a collection of vape stores, fast food franchises, the odd shop and boarded up businesses.

And today, there is a buzz in the air because their man is passing through.With 10 weeks to go until the most pivotal of elections, Donald Trump and his opponent, Kamala Harris, are criss-crossing the country, shuttling between the few swing states where the future of this country will be decided.In Pennsylvania and just a few other states, the margins are so tight, it could swing either way.And so, just as he did in 2016 and 2020, Donald Trump came to Johnstown to tell the people here, again, that he will make their lives better.""We're going to win back the White House."" he told the cheering crowd in a packed arena.""We're going to make this country greater than it's ever been... We're going to bring in tremendous numbers of factories.""Together, we will deliver low taxes, low regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates, low inflation, so that everyone can afford groceries, a car and a home.""He hit every button and here, among the faithful who attend these rallies, they believe his pledges.But here's the thing. Despite his promises, he never got the factories outside this arena re-opened when he was last president.A combination of factors is fuelling Trump's enduring appeal.Part of it is explained by deep-set conservative Christian values which Trumpian Republicanism has latched on to so well - the yearning for 'the good old days'.Part of it is the soaring inflation over the past few years - the sharp post-pandemic increase in global commodity prices, compounded by Ukraine war-related supply chain and energy delivery disruption. Here, in this rally, among Mr Trump's supporters, Joe Biden foots the blame for all that. He's been the president. No debate.But it's also viscerally clear that part of America feels marginalised and ignored as 'progressive' liberals progress with policies and lifestyles that people in places like Johnstown feel are not aligned with them or helping them.Put simply, the lives of the people in this arena felt better back under the first Trump term, despite the unfulfilled promises, because they have felt even worse through the past four years under Joe Biden.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerDonald Trump, the salesman, has harnessed this anger with pitch-perfect rhetoric.

10-09-2024,SkyNews,US,Donald Trump: How reality TV and prime-time cameos helped get him to the White House - could it happen again?,"""My name is Donald Trump and I'm the largest real estate developer in New York. I own buildings all over the place. I've mastered the art of the deal and turned the name Trump into the highest-quality brand.""This is how Donald Trump introduced himself in the opening credits of The Apprentice when it first aired on 8 January 2004.He was already a well-known businessman, having turned his father Fred's rental company into a billion-dollar real estate empire. His turbulent finances - and love life - had also gained him notoriety in the tabloid press.But it was his 11 years on The Apprentice that many say solidified his reputation - and paved the way to his shock White House win of 2016 - and second attempt at the presidency this year.'My jet's going to be in every episode'When NBC first had the idea for The Apprentice, Donald Trump was one of many moguls who would sit at the boardroom table - with others proposed to front future series.But having negotiated a 50% stake in the show and the episodes being filmed in Trump Tower, potential successors were soon shelved - and Trump stayed at the helm for 14 seasons.According to reports, filming for the first episode, ""Meet The Billionaire"", overran by hours, and Trump would call the channel at 6am the day after each one aired to get the earliest viewing figures.Seemingly laser-focused on how the show could promote his businesses, he reportedly told TV bosses at the time: ""My jet's going to be in every episode. Even if it doesn't get the ratings, it's still going to be great for my brand.""Read moreTrump's criminal casesFive things to watch at Harris-Trump debateWho's on track to win the US election?Further episodes were entitled ""Sex, Lies and Altitude"" and ""Ethics Schmethics"".Meanwhile, his opening voiceover acknowledged his previous financial difficulties, claiming, ""It wasn't always easy,"" and that ""15 years ago I was seriously in trouble  billions of dollars in debt"".But he then exclaimed: ""I fought back and I won  bigly.""I used my brain and my negotiating skills and I worked it all out. Now my company is the biggest and strongest it ever was. And I'm having more fun than I ever have.""During his time on the show, he battled bankruptcies, court cases, and personal scandal.But with 20 million viewers in the first year alone, his 'The Donald' persona and 'You're fired' catchphrase is what many Americans knew and remembered him for.Fresh Prince and Sex And The CityAfter rebranding his father's business empire the Trump Organization in 1971, he was often pictured with celebrities at parties and married Czech model and athlete Ivana Zelnickova in 1977.His longstanding feud with then New York mayor Ed Koch often played out in newspaper and magazine interviews - also helping ensure he stayed in the public eye.Meanwhile, throughout the 1980s and 1990s he bought casinos, hotels, and golf courses - as well as an American football team, 282ft yacht, and the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants.During the 1990s, he also started making cameos on TV.When the Home Alone sequel Lost In New York was released in 1992, both Trump and one of his biggest assets - Manhattan's Plaza Hotel - were featured.In 1994 he and his second wife, actress and TV presenter Marla Marples, played themselves in an episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.As prospective buyers of the family home, Will Smith's on-screen cousin Carlton screams: ""It's The Donald, oh my god!"" before fainting, before his sister Hilary says: ""You look much richer in person.""When he appeared in the sitcom The Nanny in 1996, his team is reported to have asked scriptwriters to change the reference to him from a millionaire to a billionaire.He also made appearances in the film The Little Rascals and as a business contact of a rich older man trying to seduce Kim Cattrall's character Samantha in Sex And The City.Meanwhile, the Trump empire was suffering major financial difficulty.The US recession of the early 1990s hit Trump's businesses and he eventually accumulated $5bn ( 3.8bn) in debt.He was forced to sell his airline, yacht, and take out third mortgages on most of his properties, with many banks refusing to do business with him as a result.In the 1990s and 2000s, Trump filed for bankruptcy six times.Deutsche Bank came to his rescue, however, when they entered the US market in the early 2000s offering him millions in credit to fund Trump Tower among other projects.Away from business, in 2005, Trump married his third wife, Melania.Dropped by Apprentice over Mexico claimsTrump had flirted with politics from 2000, running as a candidate for the fringe Reform Party in the California and Michigan primaries.That year, he also published a book called The America We Deserve, in which he expressed a series of conservative political views.Over the next decade, he registered as both a Republican and a Democrat.He made moves towards another presidential bid, this time as a Republican, in 2011, but ultimately declared he wouldn't run.Despite his failure to progress, he received widespread attention for promoting 'birtherism' - a conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the US.The start of Trump's political career marked the end of his time on The Apprentice.In June 2015, NBC dropped him from the show over comments during his campaign launch speech about US Mexican immigrants being ""rapists"" and ""bringing drugs"".It was during this speech that he first vowed to ""Make America Great Again"", having declared the American Dream ""dead"".His campaign was overseen by the right-wing media figure Steve Bannon, who he appointed chief executive in mid-2016. In rally speeches, he made promises to ""build a wall"" along the US-Mexico border and throw his Democrat opponent Hillary Clinton in prison over claims she was ""crooked"".He trailed in the opinion polls and an audio clip from 2005 appeared to reveal him bragging about sexually assaulting women.But despite many failing to take him seriously, the race narrowed and Clinton suffered a shock defeat, paving the way for a Trump White House in January 2017.Twitter presidentTrump continued causing controversy when he entered the Oval Office.He often bypassed official communication channels, preferring to make formal policy announcements on Twitter instead.Domestically, he made moves to dismantle Obamacare, and shifted the political makeup of the Supreme Court by nominating three conservative justices, which has since led to the overturning of constitutional abortion rights through Roe v Wade.He quickly imposed what was dubbed a 'Muslim ban', temporarily stopping immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries.Abroad, he withdrew the US from the Paris Climate Agreement and fundamentally changed trade relations with China and other key states.He was praised for spearheading the Abraham Accords, which normalised relations between Israel, the UAE, and Bahrain, and many hoped would help move closer to peace for Israel-Palestine.Despite declaring he had ""made peace in the Middle East"", however, he also withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal.Meanwhile, his 2016 election campaign was investigated for alleged Russian interference. More than 30 people were charged, with his former attorney Michael Cohen among those sent to prison. Trump himself was never indicted and the special counsel probe failed to show any criminal collusion.He was impeached twice - the first time in 2019 after an inquiry found he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to dig up dirt on his 2020 election rival Joe Biden - and the second time over the 6 January insurrection.His handling of the coronavirus pandemic was widely criticised - but supported by libertarians, mask and vaccine sceptics.Despite contracting the virus in October 2020, he repeatedly referred to it as the ""China virus"" and made false claims that bleach could cure it.At the November election, Trump got 74 million votes - more than any other sitting president in history - but lost by seven million overall.Insurrection, impeachments and indictmentsTrump immediately disputed the 2020 election result, claiming widespread electoral fraud in multiple states.His ""stop the steal"" campaign culminated in a ""Save America"" rally at Washington DC's National Mall on 6 January 2021.Ahead of the formal verification of votes by the Electoral College, Trump urged supporters to ""fight like hell"", vowing ""we will never concede"" and ""we are going to the Capitol"".When the rally ended, a mob descended on the Capitol, breaking into buildings, making death threats, and causing damage.Six people died as a result, Trump was impeached for a second time, and he faced both criminal and civil lawsuits.The aftermath saw Trump largely abandoned by the Republican Party.He refused to attend his successor's inauguration and was banned by nearly all mainstream social media platforms, leading him to set up his own - Truth Social - in 2022.Momentum began to build against him legally - and he faced criminal cases for alleged electoral fraud in Georgia, the removal of classified documents in Florida, and 'hush money' over an affair with former adult film star Stormy Daniels in New York.The Florida case was thrown out but he became the first US president in history to be convicted when he was found guilty in the hush money case. He is yet to be sentenced.Separately, he lost two civil lawsuits in New York - one for sexually assaulting and defaming the writer E Jean Caroll and a second for overvaluing his business assets to secure bank loans. The fines for both totalled almost  350m.ComebackAfter the insurrection, Republican donors, congressmen and women effectively disowned Trump and he was blamed for the party's results in the 2022 midterm elections.But he remained popular with the grassroots, and had a more direct line to them when Elon Musk took over Twitter, reinstating Trump's account.Trump used the criminal cases against him to fuel his anti-establishment image and amid poor approval ratings for Joe Biden and a lack of another clear candidate, he re-emerged as a serious contender for the Republican nomination.At the same time, Mr Biden's age and mental capacity came increasingly into question.And after confusing Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy with Russia's Vladimir Putin - and a disastrous TV debate, during which Trump said ""I don't think he knows what he said"", he was forced to pull out of the 2024 race.Trump's narrow escape from an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally emboldened him and his supporters further.His defiant raised fist and ear injury became symbols of the subsequent Republican Convention, where he formally accepted the party's nomination and his most loyal followers sported solidarity ear bandages.He now faces Kamala Harris for the presidency and a second shot at the White House on 5 November.",https://news.sky.com/story/donald-trump-how-reality-tv-and-prime-time-cameos-helped-get-him-to-the-white-house-could-it-happen-again-13210496
11-09-2024,SkyNews,US,Who is favourite to win the US election? Follow the latest polls and play our game to predict who you think will win,"The presidential election on 5 November is set to be the tightest race since at least 2000.Kamala Harris currently holds a slender lead over Donald Trump, according to the latest polls.But the US election is not all about who wins the most votes overall, it's about who wins in the right states.How does the US election work?iIf we add up the votes in ""safe"" states that the candidates probably don't need to worry about so much, Harris is on 225 electoral college votes and Trump on 219, in their race to 270.Of the 94 votes left in the eight crucial swing states where the races are tight, Harris needs 45 to win the presidency and Trump needs 51.Harris is currently leading in a majority of those.Read analysis and follow reaction of the debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump our live blogBut the leads are narrow. All it takes is for Trump to turn fortunes around in any two of the larger states and he will reach the 51 he needs to win.After the debate on 10 September, Kamala Harris also retook the lead in the betting markets, but only by the narrowest of margins, reflecting a belief among punters that the race is very far from over.Predict who you think will win in each swing state and we'll tell you who the president will be if you're right.Swing statesWe can already be fairly confident of the result in lots of states. California and New York for example have voted Democrat at every election for the past 30 years.Texas is the same the other way around - they haven't voted for a Democrat since Jimmy Carter in 1976, almost 50 years ago. Only five states changed hands in 2020.That's why those eight states that could go either way are so very important.If Trump doesn't win in Pennsylvania, his route to victory becomes increasingly narrow - he would need to win at least four of the six biggest remaining states.If he does win there, however, he can become president with just two others.There is no recent polling in Nebraska s second district by pollsters recognised by our US partners NBC News, but that single electoral vote could make all the difference if other states go a certain way.If Trump wins Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan and loses North Carolina, Arizona, Wisconsin and Nevada, he would be stuck on 269 - Nebraska 2nd would take him over the line.What happens if it's a tie in the electoral college?iEach of the fifty states, plus Washington DC, holds their own vote for president which is independent from the others.Each state is worth an amount of ""electoral college votes"" - effectively points - related to the population of the state.California, the most populous US state, has 54 electoral college votes representing their 39 million population.Wyoming, the smallest US state, has three electoral college votes representing their 600,000 population.There are 538 ""points"" in total. To become president, a candidate must get to 270 (more than half). It doesn't matter what combination of states gets them there, but some routes are easier than others.In most states - all except Nebraska and Maine - the winning candidate in a state gets all of the electoral votes available.So if Donald Trump was to win Florida by a single vote, he would get all 30 of their electoral college votes, the same as if he got 100% of the popular vote there.In Nebraska, two votes are allocated to who wins the state overall, and one each to the candidate who wins in three districts of Nebraska - making five overall. It's the same in Maine but there are only four electoral college votes up for grabs there, so its other votes are split across two districts rather than three.Who is the bookies' favourite?We ve mostly spoken about the polls so far, but there s another often overlooked way to gauge the potential outcome of the election - by looking at where people are putting their money.Betting markets, unlike polls, are driven by people willing to back their predictions with real money. This means they reflect not just today s opinions but also the collective wisdom of people who are invested in the outcome about how things might change going forward.Sky News is tracking the odds of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump winning the 2024 election. We've translated the odds into percentages to reflect the implied probability of each candidate's victory.The percentage refers to the candidates' overall chance of winning, by whatever margin, not an implied vote share or electoral college split.Who is the people's favourite?Sometimes it's not about policy but just about whether you like one candidate more than another.Americans are more likely to find Donald Trump unfavourable than favourable, but he has had a recent (relative) jump in popularity.It's the reverse for Harris at the moment - she had a brief bounce after becoming the official candidate, but has since dropped to a level close to Trump's new high.As the election approaches, keep an eye on all these trackers to see the polls and betting markets' predictions evolve, and what they reveal about where the race to become president is going.The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

Many have endured months, even years, on the road.All the latest US election updatesSometimes travelling thousands of miles through hostile countries, outwitting cartel gangs, and managing dizzyingly contradictory bureaucracy, all to get to this point: an asylum interview with United States border officials, and almost certain entry.On the migrant 'Train of Death': Electric shocks, beatings and brandingsOn its face, this all sounds like a system working in perfect harmony with the needy being helped by a welcoming country.But in reality, migration is a hotly disputed issue that is likely to dominate the Trump-Harris debate, and the run-up to the presidential election itself.You can watch live coverage of the debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump from midnight tonight on Sky News, on web and on mobileWho is ahead in the US election polls?Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsThe group I am with on the bridge is mostly from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Venezuela.They're claiming asylum, and with their paperwork and appointment email in hand, they approach the border with some trepidation but mostly with excitement and joy.Many have waited months for their appointment to come through after applying for asylum on the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) app.This group of a few hundred people on the bridge are now just a few steps from America.As they shuffle forward, CBP guards check their papers, make sure there are no errors, and wave them through to the other side for their case interviews.These families, these children, are about to start a new life.Along the border here in Matamoros, there's little sign of Donald Trump's border wall, but he'd doubtless approve of the razor wire fortifications on the American side of the Rio Grande.Experts here say there's no doubt who those seeking asylum are backing in this election and this debate - and that's Kamala Harris, who is seen to have a far less hostile approach to immigration.""I think the best would be a flexible US immigration policy again, like President Biden's when he began his administration,"" Oscar Misael Hernandez-Hernandez said as we chatted alongside the dozens of cars and trucks crossing the border.A professor of social anthropology at the El Colegio de la Frontera Norte research centre and an expert on Mexico-US border issues, he added: ""Biden broke with ultra-conservative vision and immigration policy.""So, I think if Harris implements a migration policy like this if she wins the presidency of the United States, it would be not only quite good for migrants in terms of human rights, but also quite good for international diplomacy, because the relations of the United States, at least with President Trump, if he wins, would be quite disastrous as they were in the past.""Read more:When is the US election?Terrifying risks Indians take to reach USIn shelters and hostels across Mexico, many other migrant families simply have to wait for their border appointments.It's like a lottery, and it can take a long time for their number to come up.Few leave the shelter; they would be easy prey for cartel gangs who would kidnap and hold them for ransom.Marlen Cabrera, 39, from Honduras, and her family are waiting it out along with 200 others at the Casa del Migrante San Francisco de Asis shelter.Any tightening of the immigration rules - as threatened by Donald Trump - would be a disaster for her.I asked her what she would do if the laws changed with a Trump victory. She says she doesn't like to think about what-ifs.""I've been here so long, and not being able to get in would be hard because it's the only option I have,"" she said.""I have to get in. It would be really terrible if we couldn't. And I don't just speak for myself, I speak for everyone here.""Jose Valdivia, the Nicaraguan manager of the shelter, is even clearer.""Everybody, since the last election, we all wanted the Democrats to win, right? Because the Democrats look out for the little guy,"" he told me.""That's what everybody here as a migrant wants, we want the Democrats to win.

14-08-2024,SkyNews,Climate,How climate change is driving extreme fires in Greece,"Just as an enormous wildfire tears through the suburbs of Athens, scientists in Europe are racing to understand why ""extreme"" fires like this are becoming more common.The conditions for some of these fierce blazes have become between three and 20 times more likely, according to the first research of its kind.The new annual review of what is causing extreme fires, and whether we can predict them, comes off the back of a staggeringly destructive wildfire season from March 2023 to February 2024.Record-breaking flames scorched Canada and turned skies far away in New York orange and grey. The largest recorded fires in the European Union killed 19 people in Greece, and blazes in western Amazonia brought filthy air to local towns.Today's major study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Earth System Science Data, finds carbon emissions from wildfires in 2023-2024 were 16% above average, spewing out 8.2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.And, had it not been a quiet fire season in the African savannahs, the global emission from wildfires would have been the greatest of any fire season on record since 2003, they said.What is an 'extreme' wildfire?There is no single definition of what constitutes an extreme fire, because it is relative to the location, said one of the authors Dr Douglas Kelley, from the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH).It could be measured by things like burned area, intensity, or how unusual they are, depending on the region.But they used three mega blazes in Canada, Greece, and western Amazonia last year as a benchmark.The current flames in Greece would count as an extreme fire because of its proximity to and potential damage to people, said fellow author Dr Joe McNorton from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).At 200 square kilometres, this year's fires in Greece are still much smaller than the 900 square kilometres burned last fire season.That's because the current flames are at the ""wildland-urban interface"", which brings with it ""potential loss of life, destruction, economic devastation"" said Dr McNorton.Climate change raised the chances of unprecedented fires last yearHuman-driven climate change made the tinderbox conditions of 2023-24 up to three times more likely in Greece, similar in Canada and 20 times more likely in western Amazonia, today's paper found.They then looked at ""how likely we are to get them in the future"", said Dr Kelley.If the world warms by up to 2C by 2100, sticking to Paris Agreement goals, they project such a fire in Canada will be two to three times more likely, but no change in Greece and western Amazonia.But if temperatures warm by more like 3C, extreme fires like last year will be up to 11 times more likely in Canada, three in Greece and 1.3 in western Amazonia.Other research shows the number of intense fires has been rising.How does climate change impact extreme fires?Climate change is ""clearly increasing"" fire conditions, said Dr Matthew Jones from the University of East Anglia.Warmer temperatures dry out forests, which make a fire ""more likely to spread"", said Dr Kelley. It can also cause more vegetation to grow, which provides more ""fuel"" for the fire.Human factors also influence fires, like starting them themselves, or breaking up the landscape, or how well they fight them.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerHow do fires impact climate change?Although the number of extreme fires is on the up, the total amount of land being burned has been decreasing.That is a bit of a ""red herring"" said Dr Jones, because it's due to a fall in the less harmful savannah fires, as things like agriculture break up the grassland, often bringing better protection or irrigation.But what scientists are really concerned about is the rise in wildfires in forests.Forest wildfires release more carbon emissions, pose a higher risk to people, take longer to recover, and mean the loss of huge carbon storage.Read more from Sky News:New warning about 'demise' of Great Barrier ReefBritain's smallest house 'at risk' due to climate changeThat's why global fire emissions have barely budged even though land area burned has fallen - and there's a fear global emissions from fires could soon increase.More extreme fires in Canada and western Amazonia are ""quite worrying... in ecosystems which hold a lot of carbon and in some cases, don't experience much fire today, so they haven't really adapted to it,"" said Dr Kelley.What can be done?Dr Clair Barnes from Imperial College London, who was not involved with the study, said she hopes the report will both ""guide preparations for wildfires, and help the world understand the simple fact that fires will keep getting worse until fossil fuels are replaced with renewable energy sources"".Scientists agree that emissions need to fall in order to avoid future risk - but that will take a long time to have an impact.In the meantime, the authors said, leaders should consider protecting forest boundaries, reducing the amount of natural fuel fire, imposing fire bans on high-risk days, and investing more in early warning prediction systems.",https://news.sky.com/story/how-climate-change-is-driving-extreme-fires-in-greece-13196440
06-08-2024,SkyNews,Climate,Customers demand water firms are held to account - but talks over fines reveal tension at heart of industry,"The  168m fines levied on three water companies by Ofwat are part of a slow - many argue far too slow - reckoning for the industry for the routine release of sewage via storm overflows.For Thames Water, predictably hit with the largest fine of  104m, close to the maximum penalty available to the regulator, it is also another blow to its credibility and bottom line in an increasingly desperate search for investors to secure its future.The sewage problem first. Storm overflows are the emergency release valve for our largely Victorian water infrastructure, in which rain water and wastewater ultimately share the same pipes.As the name suggests, their primary purpose is to divert water from the system during inundations, when the alternative would be for drain water to back up into people's homes.The grim reality of their operation, largely revealed thanks to a campaign of increased monitoring by concerned citizens, is that the use of storm outflows have become routine, with more than 460,000 incidents in 2023 - a 54% increase year-on-year.Ofwat found that all three companies - Thames Water, Yorkshire Water and Northumbrian Water - had failed not only to prevent routine spills, but often did not understand the scale of the problem.David Black, chief executive of Ofwat, told Sky News Thames Water did not even know about 300 of the 500 overflows in its network.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerFor Britain's largest water company, with 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley, this is another blow to its reputation and bottom line.Drowning in debt after a decade of mismanagement, Thames was already struggling to secure the fresh investment it needs to shore up the business and deliver infrastructure improvements.Earlier this year, chief executive Chris Weston described the company as ""uninvestable"" after existing shareholders pulled a  3.25bn equity injection, and last month said it only has enough cash to survive until next May without fresh funding.Read more from business:Asia's markets rebound after worldwide plungeMusk ramps up war of words with StarmerGoogle 'illegally maintained search monopoly'Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeThames has even argued that it should face lower fines to help protect its financial position in negotiations with the regulator.This captures the tension at the heart of the privatised water model and the regulator's role.It only works if water companies are attractive to investors, but customers demand that they be held to account with severe financial penalties that can undermine the proposition.As a  20bn company with  2bn of revenue and a monopoly on a fundamental utility, Thames Water remains attractive to investors, but the current ones will likely have to take a substantial hit first.Ofwat insists that the companies cannot recover these fines from customers, but bills will increase as part of an industry-wide settlement that will be agreed by the end of the year.The regulator approved average increases of 23% last month in exchange for  88bn of spending over the next five years, the bulk of it on daily operations, a figure the industry says is too low to deliver change.",https://news.sky.com/story/customers-demand-water-firms-are-held-to-account-but-talks-over-record-fines-reveal-tension-at-heart-of-industry-13191778

Is lab-grown meat as nutritious as the real thing - and is it safe?Such questions about new ""alternative proteins"" will be answered, it is hoped, by a new multimillion pound venture to try to get more insects, fungi, and cultivated (sometimes called ""lab-grown"") meat onto our plates.The global population is growing dramatically, and so is its appetite for animal protein like cheese, ham and burgers.But animals raised for food can be terrible for the planet - destroying rainforests, adding to climate change and guzzling water - as well as for animal welfare and for our health in terms of fat and processing.Keeping everyone nourished without eating up more land that's needed to slow climate change and protects ecosystems is a dilemma that has fuelled the growth of the ""alternative protein"" sector.This covers a range of proteins that need much less energy and land, including insects, fungi, algae, microbes brewed like beer, cultivated meat, and even veggie sausages made from something like mushrooms.But the sector has hardly got off the ground - only 9% of protein sold in UK supermarkets comes from plants rather than animals, according to WWF, and cultivated meat hasn't yet been approved for human consumption.How many 'pollution hotspots' are there in your constituency, according to Friends of the EarthHunters to be paid to kill extra deer in Scotland in trial conservation schemeNew mothers breastfeed in front of endangered orangutan to try to show her how to care for babyBut alternative proteins could be worth  6.8bn a year and create 25,000 jobs by 2035, one analysis by the thinktank Green Alliance suggests, and boost food security.That's why the UK's innovation agency, UKRI, has just dished out  15m to the newly formed National Alternative Protein Innovation Centre (NAPIC), launching today.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerThe collaboration between different research groups is also backed by a further  23m from other stakeholders including business, farming groups, regulators and the third sector (charities, social enterprises and community groups).""We want to make alternative protein mainstream, for a really sustainable planet,"" said Professor Anwesha Sarkar, a food material scientist from Leeds University and NAPIC project leader.The aim is to build up more evidence about the health benefits and risks, how to keep farmers in work and how to test out what the British public will stomach.It will also look at how to unblock barriers to getting the products onto shop shelves, like outdated regulatory systems or slow testing processes.They hope to be the ""catalyst"" to scale up proteins and make the UK a ""global superpower"" in alternative proteins, Prof Sarkar said. The UK is striking out alone in Europe as the EU shies away from it, and Italy has even banned lab-grown meat.Singapore, Israel and pockets of the US have approved cultivated meat for human consumption, while the UK has allowed it in pet food.But the total  38m funding is a drop in the ocean of the global industry, which raised $1.6bn ( 1.2bn) last year alone.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeMany UK start-ups are trying their hand in the sector, with Better Dairy brewing milk protein to make cheese in a process called precision fermentation, or Oxford's Ivy Farm taking a tiny sample of animal stem cells that it can then stimulate to make them replicate indefinitely.But not everyone is on board already.Some animal farmers fear yet another threat to their livelihoods, while others are worried that many alternative proteins are ""ultra-processed foods"" (UPFs) - a somewhat controversial term that has been the subject of much recent debate.But it ""all depends on what you are comparing it with"", said Professor Tim Spector, co-founder of the ZOE nutrition project and an expert on the health risks of ultra-processed food.He said ultra-processed alternative proteins are ""probably slightly better"" for you than UP meats, because they can contain more fibre and nutrients, he said.""Probably the choices we make on our food are the biggest single factors we can do as individuals to help our planet... so that's why I'm generally in favour of alternate proteins.""Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsIt will take some years before the project starts to deliver, and it will be up to government to translate the evidence into policy and legislation.A government spokesperson said: ""Everyone should have access to a varied, healthy diet and make their own choices about what they eat.""This government is committed to supporting a food system that produces sustainable, healthy and affordable food, while ensuring the right outcomes for consumers, farmers and food producers.""",https://news.sky.com/story/are-alternative-proteins-going-mainstream-this-multimillion-pound-new-project-hopes-so-13204117

But it can lead to severe lung infections, including pneumonia and infant bronchiolitis, and is a leading cause of infant mortality globally.Officials suggest the vaccine programme could ease the pressure on the NHS.Here is what you need to know about RSV, its symptoms, the complications it can cause and the vaccine rollout.What is RSV?RSV is short for respiratory syncytial virus.It is a very common virus and most children will have had it by the time they are two.However, it can reinfect older children and adults may also catch it. Older adults are particularly at risk of complications.Illness from the virus is the main cause of winter pressures in children's hospitals each year, leading to increased demands on paediatric intensive care units and cancelled operations.It accounts for approximately 20,000 hospital admissions in children under one year and is responsible for 20 to 30 infant deaths in the UK each year, according to the Department of Health and Social Care.What are the symptoms of RSV?Most children infected with RSV will only experience mild symptoms, including:  runny nose  decrease in appetite  coughing  sneezing  fever  wheezingThese symptoms usually come in stages, rather than all at once. In very young children, the only symptoms may be irritability, decreased activity, and breathing difficulties.What are the possible complications?RSV can cause a chest infection called bronchiolitis, which mainly affects children under two.It is usually mild and can be treated at home, according to the NHS, but it can be serious.Bronchiolitis is not the same as bronchitis, which causes a cough with lots of mucus and can affect people of all ages.The symptoms of bronchiolitis include:  breathing more quickly  finding it difficult to feed or eat  noisy breathing (wheezing)  becoming irritableSymptoms are usually worst between days three and five, and the cough usually gets better in three weeks, the NHS says.Some children have a higher risk of getting seriously ill with bronchiolitis, including children born very prematurely, those with a heart or lung condition or a weakened immune system.About three in 100 babies with bronchiolitis will need hospital treatment, according to Asthma + Lung UK.Read more from Sky News:Should you get the flu jab? Why it's not just a 'bad cold'Measles warning amid 'devastating resurgence' of diseaseWhen should you seek treatment?The NHS advises parents to call 999 or go to A&E if any of the following happens:  your child is having difficulty breathing - you may notice grunting noises or their tummy sucking under their ribs  there are pauses when your child breathes  your child's skin, tongue or lips are blue  your child is floppy and will not wake up or stay awake.Parents should ask for an urgent GP appointment or call 111 if any of the following happens:  your child has had a cold and it's getting worse  your child is feeding or eating much less than normal  your child has had a dry nappy for 12 hours or more, or shows other signs of dehydration  your baby is under 3 months and has a temperature of 38C or more, or is older than 3 months and has a temperature of 39C or higher  your baby feels hotter than usual when you touch their back or chest, or feels sweaty  your child is very tired or irritable.How does the vaccine rollout work?It started on 1 September, with women being offered it from 28 weeks into pregnancy and a one-off catch up programme to target those aged between 75 and 79 to ensure older people are protected going into this winter.The vaccine, which is given via injection into your upper arm, will be offered to eligible people through the NHS.Women should be offered the vaccine at around the time of their 28-week antenatal appointment, as getting vaccinated as close to 28 weeks as possible provides the best protection for babies, the NHS says.They advise speaking to your maternity service or GP surgery if you're 28 weeks pregnant or more and have not been offered the vaccine.People aged 75 to 79 should also be offered the vaccine by their GP surgery.What treatment is available if someone gets RSV?There is no specific treatment for RSV and instead treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms.The anti-viral drug ribavirin has been licensed for treating RSV and is sometimes used in severe cases, but its effectiveness has not been established.At home, symptoms of RSV and bronchiolitis can be treated with child paracetamol or ibuprofen. Saline nasal drops may make it easier for them to breathe, and feeding babies upright can also help.In hospital, a child with bronchiolitis may be given extra oxygen. If they are struggling to feed, they may be given food or fluids through a feeding tube. They may also be treated with nasal suction to get rid of excess mucus in the nostrils.'Vaccine can prevent trauma'Health minister Andrew Gwynne has shared his family's experience with RSV.His grandson was just weeks old when he contracted the virus, which developed into bronchiolitis.He was put in an induced coma by medics and spent two weeks in intensive care.""It was just heart-breaking watching this tiny, weeks old baby just helpless on the machine,"" Mr Gwynne said.""Around 20,000 babies a year are hospitalised with RSV, and very tragically between 20 and 30 a year will die from it.""And yet it's entirely preventable. So that's why this vaccine is so important.""I don't want any parent or grandparent to have to go through the trauma that we went through with our grandson with something that is entirely preventable, which RSV is.""Mr Gwynne added that the vaccine ""will ease enormous pressure on the NHS"".Christine Burlison, whose baby became seriously ill from the virus, is urging pregnant women to take up the new vaccine.Her daughter, Aria, was 11 days old when she began struggling to breathe and was taken to hospital.Doctors said she had developed bronchiolitis, a blocking of the airways in the lungs, as a result of RSV.""Now having the option of a vaccine that could prevent other families having to go through the same experiences as ours did is simply amazing,"" Ms Burlison said.""The most terrible thing that you can face as a parent is seeing your child struggling to breathe.""Having that protection for a newborn is all you could wish for.""",https://news.sky.com/story/what-is-rsv-symptoms-complications-and-when-parents-should-seek-medical-help-13012335
24-08-2024,SkyNews,Science & Tech,Two astronauts are stuck in space - how will they pass time (and survive) until 2025?,"It sounds like the plot of a sci-fi film: two astronauts are stranded in space and won't be coming back for another six months.Sunita ""Suni"" Williams and Commander Barry ""Butch"" Wilmore arrived at the International Space Station (ISS) in June as the first crew to test Boeing's new Starliner, which suffered helium leaks and thruster failures before it docked - raising questions over how safe it is for the return flight.Boeing has insisted the astronauts are not stuck and said ""there's no increased risk"" in bringing them back in the Starliner, but NASA has opted to bring them back on a SpaceX flight in February 2025 instead.They should have only been in space for eight days, but they've now been there for nearly three months.But do they have enough supplies for another six months, how are they coping mentally and what is day-to-day life like at the ISS?Size and facilitiesThe ISS is 356ft (109m) end-to-end, one yard shy of the full length of an American football field including the end zones.The living and work space, NASA says, is larger than a six-bedroom house, and has six sleeping quarters, two bathrooms, a gym, and a 360-degree view bay window.As you'll see later, it's not quite as luxurious as it sounds.Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore aren't alone; they're sharing the facilities with seven other astronauts from other missions; four of them fellow Americans and three of them Russians.Is there enough food, water and oxygen?Yes, there are reserve supplies up there to keep astronauts going for plenty of time.The space station has its own oxygen-generating systems, and about 50% of oxygen exhaled from carbon dioxide is recovered.As for water, the station has a urine-into-drinking-water recycling system, and a part of that system also captures moisture released into the cabin air from the crew's breath and sweat.Food supplies are a bit fancier. Meals are created at NASA's Space Food Systems Laboratory in Houston, where chefs focus on making food appetising as well as nutritious.Much of it is dehydrated, meaning it has to be filled up with water before being consumed, while some is ready-made and just needs to be heated.There's meat (barbecued beef brisket is one example of a meal on offer), eggs, vegetables, bread, savoury snacks and sweet treats in the station's kitchen.Crew members are also allowed to request some of their own personal favourites from off the shelves.In a video on NASA's YouTube channel, Ms Williams revealed her favourite commodity was Nutter Butter spread - and showed off a jar her family had sent up for her.When were supplies last sent?The spacecraft regularly receives more supplies from Earth, with the last one arriving on 6 August.Launched on a rocket from Kazakhstan on 30 May, the supplies included about three tonnes of food, fuel and other supplies for Ms Williams, Mr Wilmore and the seven other crew members on board.The crew can essentially place their orders for what they want to come on these crafts by speaking to Mission Control ahead of launches.That was good news for Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams, who were forced to ditch their personal suitcases before taking off in June to make room for extra equipment, meaning they've had to wear spare clothes that were already at the ISS upon arrival.Their own clothes finally arrived with the 6 August supplies, and more supplies are set to be sent up in a few months.Once supply ships are emptied at the ISS, the crew fill them with their rubbish before sending them back to Earth.How do you use a toilet without gravity?There are some things space-based movies just don't cover - but Ms Williams got into the grittier details of space life on NASA's YouTube channel.In the video filmed in 2012, Ms Williams showed off the toilet, which somewhat resembles one you might see on an aeroplane.Read more:Army barracks to house deep space radar to help protect the UKHow blasting 'glitter' into Mars' atmosphere could make it more habitableThe difference is there are two separate tubes to go in - one for urine and one for poo. The urine one, which is coloured yellow, is attached to the wall and almost looks like a vacuum cleaner - and fittingly it has a suction function to prevent gravity from causing a mess.The tube for poo looks like more of a typical toilet, with a seat too - though you have to hold on to a handle on the wall next to it to avoid floating away as you go.On the bright side, there's about half-a-dozen types of toilet paper stuffed into bags on the toilet walls, including wet wipes and disinfectant wipes in case ""things don't go correctly,"" as Ms Williams puts it.Astronauts are also each given toiletry kits that come with things like a toothbrush and toothpaste (which you have to either swallow or spit into a tissue) and a hairbrush - which Ms Williams says is pointless in space because gravity constantly keeps your hair upright.What about sleeping arrangements?Remarkably you can sleep on the floor, on the wall or on the ceiling.That's because without gravity, the crew never feel like they are lying down. It makes no difference whether they are on the floor, standing up or upside down - it all feels the same.So the ISS has sleeping stations about the size of phone booths that the crew get into, which consist of a sleeping bag and a pillow on the floor, wall and ceiling.Leisure timeWhen they aren't running space experiments, the crew can enjoy their view of Earth from the station's observatory deck, or head to the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) in the Tranquillity node - a fancy term for gym equipment.The ARED offers traditional upper and lower-body exercises, such as squats, dead lift, heel raises, bicep curls and bench press by using vacuum cylinders to replicate weights in gyms.The crew is encouraged to use it throughout their space stays, as muscle and bone loss is common on long missions.How are the pair feeling?They are both retired navy captains and longtime NASA astronauts who already have long space station missions behind them.Mr Wilmore, 61, and Ms Williams, 58, said going into this test flight that they expected to learn a lot about Starliner and how it operates.At their only news conference from space in July, they assured reporters they were keeping busy, helping with repairs and research, and expressed confidence in all the Starliner testing going on behind the scenes.""I have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem,"" Ms Williams told reporters.""That mantra you've heard, 'Failure is not an option,' that's why we are staying here now,"" Mr Wilmore said.""We trust that the tests that we're doing are the ones we need to do to get the right answers, to give us the data that we need to come back.""Mr Wilmore's wife Deanna told AP in early August that he is ""content"" at the space station, ""neither worrying nor fretting"".She said Mr Widmore, who is a longtime elder at a church in Texas, has faith God is in control, and that this gives his family ""great peace"".In its latest update, NASA said Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore both supported the plan to come back in a SpaceX craft ""fully"".What's happening now?Starliner will now return to Earth unmanned, while the two astronauts are set to return in February on aSpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft which is due to launch next month as part of a routine astronaut rotation mission.In a recent press conference, NASA administrator Bill Nelson said returning on the Starliner craft would be too dangerous.""Spaceflight is risky,"" he said. ""Even at its safest, and even at its most routine. A test flight by nature is neither safe nor routine.""Associate administrator Jim Free then added: ""The uncertainty in our [technological] margins is what drove our decision.""Many of Starliner's thrusters in the propulsion system overheated when fired and leaks of helium, used to pressurise the thrusters, appear to be connected to how frequently they are used, NASA's commercial crew manager Steve Stich previously explained.Speaking at the most recent press conference, Mr Stitch explained: ""The bottom line relative to bringing Starliner back is there was just too much uncertainty in the prediction of the thrusters.""If we had a model - if we had a way to accurately predict what the thrusters would do for the undock and all the way through the deorbit burn and through the separation sequence, I think we would have taken a different course of action.""But when we looked at the data and looked at the potential for thruster failures with a crew on board, and then getting into this very tight sequence of finishing the deorbit burn, which puts the vehicle on an entry, and then immediately manoeuvring from that into a step sequence to separate the service module and crew module, it was just too much risk for the crew.""Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeWill this be the longest anyone has spent in space?No - Russian Valeri Polyakov set that record in the mid-1990s, spending 437 days off Earth.And last year NASA astronaut Frank Rubio came back from a 371-day trip alongside Russian astronauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin, breaking the record for the longest amount of time spent in space by an American.That trip, much like this one, was prolonged by technical difficulties, and was only meant to take six months.",https://news.sky.com/story/how-will-two-astronauts-stuck-in-space-pass-time-and-survive-until-2025-13194024

06-09-2024,SkyNews,Science & Tech,"Inside clinic which uses HD cameras, radar and lasers during controversial high-tech MOTs","A new high-tech screening clinic co-founded by the boss of Spotify hopes to revolutionise healthcare by picking up signs of disease long before there are any symptoms.Neko Health uses high resolution cameras, lasers and radar to capture millions of data points around the body, checking for problems that could become serious and even life-threatening in future.It's the latest in a wave of companies offering controversial high-tech MOTs. Some doctors warn they may increase health inequities and add to NHS workload by referring people with potentially insignificant findings.Daniel Ek - the chief executive of the music streaming service - and his partner Hjalmar Nilsonne want to engage with the debate.In one of the clinic's softly-lit scanning rooms, Hjalmar tells me that healthcare has traditionally been about treating symptoms - ""reactive"", as he calls it.""We have to find a way to become more proactive, more preventative, to help people stay healthy longer,"" he says.""Instead of giving them medicine, give them long-term health.""Neko Health's first clinic outside its hometown of Stockholm, Sweden, is a world away from the busy London shopping street that it lies beneath.It looks like something straight out of sci-fi.In the centre of the room is a booth not unlike the teleporters in Star Trek.Step inside and nine cameras - HD, 3D and thermal - take more than 2,000 images to build a high-resolution map of every mole, freckle and blemish on your skin.If you return for annual checks it allows the clinic to track changes in size, pigmentation and other warning signs of skin cancer.Next to the booth there's more tech that could easily have been wielded by Star Trek's Dr McCoy on his starship crewmates.To spot early signs of cardiovascular disease lasers analyse the stiffness of arterial walls, shimmering patterns of green light check blood circulation and blood pressure cuffs take simultaneous readings on all four limbs.There's a blood sample taken too to measure cholesterol, blood glucose, biomarkers of inflammation and lots more.In less than an hour millions of data points are collected and analysed, with a doctor explaining the findings.For the record I, like 79% of those scanned in the Stockholm clinic's first year, got a clean bill of health.But 14% of the clients in Sweden needed medical treatment for something picked up in the health check. And 1% had potentially life-saving care for serious problems they were previously unaware of.More than three-quarters of customers have booked again for a year's time. Most, it seems, consider the checks worth the  300 cost.It's a growing market.You can pay several thousands to companies offering whole-body MRI scans to see what's going on below the skin.Kim Kardashian gave a celebrity buzz to a company called Prenuvo by referring to its scanner as a ""life-saving machine"" in an Instagram post.The shift towards disease prevention has big champions.Professor Sir John Bell, now of the Ellison Institute of Technology in Oxford, was instrumental in creating the UK Biobank, Genomics England, and more recently the Our Future Health study - all initiatives to dive deep into patient data to spot signs of disease.He says preventative health checks will be the norm in the next 10 years.Not the rudimentary lifestyle questionnaires the NHS offers to mid-life patients now. There'll be far more tech - and AI - running the rule over our inner health.But it's a mindshift for the NHS.""People don't want to talk to you about cardiac problems until you have chest pain, and then they're quite keen to talk to you,"" Professor Bell says.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for free""But the trouble is, they picked it up too late because for the last 35 or 40 years it's been accumulating in your cardiac vessels. You've been asymptomatic, so nobody's done anything about it.""Understanding which diseases you have and capturing them fast at their earliest stage will mean you have a much longer, healthy life expectancy.""But other doctors are more cautious.Dr Saira Ghafur, a respiratory physician at Imperial College London, is concerned that the people who are most likely to have underlying health problems are the least likely to be able to afford private check-ups. It could make existing health inequalities even worse, she fears.There's also the risk private health checks will add to NHS waiting lists, Dr Ghafur tells me. They'll pick up lots of issues that need NHS follow-up but ultimately turn out to be nothing to worry about.And then there's the lack of evidence that the issues picked up actually matter.""We have to make sure that we're doing prevention right,"" she says. ""For that, we need a very strong evidence base.""But we are going to have to wait many years to be able to show that doing this screening, collecting these data points, has actually resulted in better (health) outcomes.""That hasn't deterred people from signing up to Neko Health. Its Stockholm clinic has a waiting list of 20,000 and it expects strong demand for checks at its London branch.Hjalmar Nilsonne comes from a family of doctors and says he understands the concerns of an overworked medical profession.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsThe company does follow-up checks itself to be sure the problems picked up on scan are significant before telling people to seek NHS treatment.He wants the health service to see preventative health checks as a help, not a hindrance.""70% of the healthcare costs in society come from chronic disease,"" he says.

The action had little effect on the availability of Telegram there, but did spark mass protests in Moscow and criticism from non-governmental organisations (NGOs).The app is becoming increasingly popular, and is now among the top five most downloaded around the world, the company says.

28-08-2024,SkyNews,Business,Has the Nike trainer bubble burst?,"The trainer market is more diverse and competitive than ever before, and its biggest player has felt the pinch.While new brands have been popping up and taking market share, Nike suffered its biggest single day drop in share price on record in late June.A whopping $28bn ( 21.6bn) was shaved off in market capitalisation overnight after the company's management reported an expected sale drop in early 2025.But why has this happened?Nike remains the biggest sports retailer in the world and still has the largest slice of market share. According to analysts, however, strategic decisions at boardroom level have contributed to a downturn in its fortunes - with consumer concerns and the emergence of new competition also in play.Shift in strategyJohn Donahoe became Nike's chief executive in January 2020 and was tasked with updating the company's online operation and bringing in more digital revenue.Mr Donahoe, 64, arrived from one of the world's biggest ecommerce companies, eBay, and quickly began shifting Nike's focus towards its digital sales efforts and away from the high street.Shortly after, the COVID pandemic hit, and the world's shoppers were forced online whether they liked it or not.With people not going into offices to work, there was no need to buy smart, formal footwear. Comfortable, everyday shoe sales rose, and Nike's profits surged past projections.Everything looked to be going well, so Mr Donahoe doubled down, accelerating the digital strategy and moving Nike out of hundreds of bricks-and-mortar stores.Soon, Nike had severed a third of its relationships with sales partners.""The consumer today is digitally grounded and simply will not revert back,"" said Mr Donahoe on an earnings call in 2020.Nike executives believed they were the ones best able to deliver their vision straight to consumers, and they didn't need retailers like FootLocker and JD Sports diluting that as middle men.But as lockdowns ended across the world, people returned to stores and online sales slowed, and the decisions that had been made started to be questioned.""I think they underestimated the cultural aspect of brick-and-mortar shopping as part of the social life of young consumers,"" Daniel Herval, who worked at Nike between 2017-20 in product creation on some of its biggest trainers, including Air Max, Jordan and Air Force 1, told the Money blog.""Nike thought people had shifted to online, and they'd left the brick-and-mortar experience behind.""But as soon as things started reopening, the social aspect of shopping, the community bonding aspect of shopping, returned, and Nike weren't really there.""Nike had started to change tack by the time people returned to stores, but it had lost pace against other brands.Competition and innovationNike's rivals weren't going to stand still while this was happening, and sure enough, retailers that had once had Nike shoes front and centre on their shelves looked for other brands to fill the space.Newer brands like Asics, Deckers Outdoor's HOKA and Roger Federer-backed On emerged, taking a steadily growing portion of the market share.And those companies quickly began to show off new ideas, notably in a corner of the market that Nike has long dominated - performance running.HOKA's thick foam soles are a huge draw for runners, while On's well-marketed (and now patented) cushioning system technology has proved popular for casuals and professionals alike.Nike, it is perceived by some, has lagged behind in the sports lifestyle scene, too. Adidas's Samba and Gazelle lines, and New Balance's 990s, have grown in popularity - even Rishi Sunak notoriously owned a pair of Sambas...So where has Nike's innovation been during this time?The air cushioning inside the soles of trainers - known as the Air Max bubble - debuted all the way back in 1978.The flyknit material, which was released back in 2012, Mr Herval says, is the last major performance innovation that managed to trickle into the lifestyle brand in a major commercial way.A survey of US teenagers by Piper Sandler earlier this year backed up the idea that while Nike remains the favourite, it was losing ""mindshare"" to innovative brands like Hoka and On.Nike appears to have acknowledged the problem, announcing a ""multi-year innovation cycle"" in April.Two key complaints from the streetsTo find out how consumers feel about Nike's shoes in 2024, there are few better places to go searching than The Basement.Launched on Facebook over a decade ago, the online group of streetwear fanatics has just over 150,000 members from across the globe and is a go-to authority on all things street fashion, including trainers.Need to check if the hoodie you just bought on eBay really is a vintage Ralph Lauren? Ask The Basement. Want to launch your own line of bespoke sunglasses but need advice starting a small fashion business? Ask The Basement.Looking for consumers to tell you why fewer people are buying Nike trainers in 2024? You get the picture.When we asked The Basement's members for their thoughts on Nike, there were two issues that came back with almost every response.The first of those is the price point, which is now largely unaffordable for the exact demographic that historically bought Nike's trainers in droves.Have a look on Nike's website, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a new-release trainer costing less than  120. Most of the ""hotly anticipated"" shoes sit between the  150- 200 mark.For the classic products, like the Air Max 95, a new pair starts at  174.99. Some traditionally cheaper options, like the Air Jordan 1s, are now around  130 on retailers including JD Sports, Size? and ASOS."" 200 isn't an accessible price point,"" said one member of The Basement. ""People have got older and smarter.""""I worked for a footwear retailer for four years,"" said another. ""Nike's biggest killer was easily their price hikes.""When I started collecting Jordans they were  105, within 10 years the same model is  190 - you can't justify that!""The testimonies go on and on. As do those raising consumers' second-biggest gripe with Nike trainers - quality control.Anecdotal reports of botched products are not hard to find, with many buyers frustrated that, after spending a lot of money on new shoes, they've received trainers covered in glue stains, with mismatched logos, missing patterns, misshaped heels and more among the complaints.Quality control is a hands-on process that involves both manual and automated procedures, and as such it is not foolproof.But the sheer number of reports of errors indicates this is not just a few faulty Air Forces.There are tens of millions of hits on TikTok for the term ""Nike quality control"" and - spoiler alert - most videos aren't of people sharing how delighted they are with their new trainer purchases.""Why would I spend  200 on a pair of Nike trainers that will probably arrive covered in glue stains and break after a month, when I could get a perfect pair of New Balance for  150?"" asks a member of The Basement.""Quality has taken a dive. Anyone who has ever worked for somewhere stocking Nike knows that glue smell off the pallet far too well,"" says another.Bouncing back via ParisBut it's not all doom and gloom for Nike. There was a golden marketing ace up its sleeve this summer - Paris 2024.The world's biggest brands see the Olympics as an opportunity to get in front of a global audience, and Nike is no different. Good publicity and brand image can instil customer confidence and improve share price - getting things right in Paris was key.The sportswear giant announced before the Games that it would be spending more on it than it had for any previous edition.""This will be the most investment and the biggest moment for Nike in years,"" Heidi O'Neill, Nike's president of consumer, product and brand, said in April, three months before the Games began.Nike secured itself as an official sponsor for Team USA, meaning so long as the athletes performed as expected, the swoosh would be on top of the podium.And so it was. Simone Biles won three golds in gymnastics, Noah Lyles took 100m glory and swimmer Katie Ledecky featured on the podium four times.Lifetime Nike endorser LeBron James laced up some very on-the-nose metallic gold style trainers from his own custom LeBron 22 signature line on his way to a gold medal.And it's not just while competing that the Nike tick got its moment. Every US athlete received a special package containing 50 items of apparel, footwear and accessories, including ""interview wear"" and ""village wear"" to keep branding visible at every moment possible in Paris.That was important, because Paris 2024 broke records for its worldwide audience. In the UK, BBC Sport's coverage of the games was streamed 218 million times, more than double the number recorded in Tokyo.Across the pond, NBCUniversal's multiplatform coverage drew in record advertising money and averaged 30.6 million daily viewers.What did that all mean for Nike? In the opening week of the Olympics, from 26 July to 1 August, it managed to increase visits to its websites, while its direct rival Adidas saw its visits decline compared with the week before.Importantly, Nike was able to convert a lot of visits to its website into sales, according to data from Similarweb. And it did that more than its rivals.Nike is ""still a struggling brand overall"", said Drew Haines, the merchandising director at retailer StockX.""But the Olympics, it definitely drives interest in these things. Nike is the one that's really winning there.""Where now?The marketing boost provided by the Olympics won't suddenly end all Nike's perceived and real problems, but it's clearly a step in the right direction.Even now, the share price has slowly started to recover, gaining around 14% in the past month after recent investment from US billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman.""Nike's ability to just go beyond the pure product conversation, the ability to connect to consumers, is second to none,"" says Mr Herval.""It's going to take a couple of years. But I truly, firmly believe that the brand is still able to rebound.""Nike did not respond to a request to participate in this article.",https://news.sky.com/story/has-the-nike-trainer-bubble-burst-13201625
13-08-2024,SkyNews,Business,Is this the end of the pub?,"Mourning his mother's death and celebrating her life at the Old Neighbourhood Inn was the obvious choice for Martin Leach, 72, from Chalford Hill, near Stroud.The wood-beamed pub opposite his home had been woven into the fabric of the village for 150 years, so it made sense for 90 friends and family members to gather there in 2015 to say their final goodbyes to Nellie ""Lilian"" Leach.But seven years later, the village would say goodbye to the Old Neighbourhood too; its only pub shuttering its doors in a scene playing out hundreds of times over across the UK - and at an accelerating pace.""Entirely pissed off,"" said Mr Leach, when asked how he felt about the closure of the pub, which had once played host to local bands, mobile bakeries, artisan vendors and an affectionate black Labrador.""The pub was all that was left to represent that [village] community, and that's gone. And I think it's important to have that sense of community otherwise we just turn into a bunch of hamsters in cages.""Some 239 pubs closed in England and Wales during the first three months of the year, according to government figures - 56% more than in the same period in 2023.""There's a sense of death by a thousand cuts or 'what fresh hell is this?'"" said Dr Thomas Thurnell-Read, a sociology expert at Loughborough University who has extensively researched pub closures.""Everything cumulatively is building up and that's why, sadly, there isn't a magic bullet for the problems in the sector.""Gen Z's changing habitsYoung people are more health and fitness conscious and more time-poor than their parents were, said Dr Thurnell-Read.The financial burden of university is rising, meaning students are taking part-time jobs and reducing the social time when drinking habits could form, he said.Freshers' week, once a party-filled gateway to three years of drinking, has become a box to tick and leave behind.""A generation of young people are finding other ways to socialise without automatically reaching for alcohol.""COVID played some part in this trend, said Dr Thurnell-Read. His students who started their degrees during social restrictions don't routinely go for big nights out or spontaneous, post-lecture pints.Between 2011 and 2022, the proportion of non-drinkers increased from 16% to 19%, according to Drinkaware's analysis of NHS data.It's a trend driven by 16-24-year-olds (26%) and resisted by adults aged between 55 and 64 (14%).Less cash, more alternatives""The younger generation don't drink as much, that's definitely a noticeable thing, but I don't think anyone really does anymore. I don't really see the culture of when people used to go out and drink - like properly drink,"" said Simon Goodman, 44, owner of the Duke of Cumberland Arms, Henley.The publican, who has been in the industry for 18 years, said that trade between the start of the year and the start of summer was ""the quietest I have ever seen it"".""People just weren't around. It's very bizarre after being in the business like this for so long.""The public have little money left over after paying their bills and more places to spend it, said Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA).This was a trend that began in 2003, when the Licensing Act gave new types of venues the right to sell alcohol, not just pubs and clubs.Now the cost of living crisis looms large. One in five people who would usually go weekly to pubs and restaurants said they were doing so less often in a survey by consultancy firm CGA in April.At the same time, skyrocketing rents and mortgages have led to a squeeze on leisure time, with people spending longer commuting in order to afford homes in cheaper locations, added Dr Thurnell-Read.""The big shift I think has been home entertainment. One of the other effects of COVID was it showed everyone how easy it was to get just about everything delivered to your front door,"" Mr Stainer said.This is a setback profoundly familiar to the manager of the Queen Inn, Great Corby, in Carlisle, which closed on 30 June.Punters thinned out because they had a ""vast amount of options at their fingertips"" at home and supermarket alcohol was significantly cheaper, said Katie Wilkinson.""It's a big shame,"" Ms Wilkinson said: ""It means the village won't have a pub anymore and a lot of people rely on coming in each night for that social aspect.""She said this was particularly important for older people: ""They see each other every night and now they won't.""I think as we move forward more and more smaller village pubs will be closing.""The real estate incentiveAs pubs become less profitable, companies that own the land are knocking them down to cash in on the real estate value ""time and time again"", said Dr Thurnell-Read.""Pubs are being closed against the will of the people who run them and often against the will of the community who need them.""One of those community members is Tricia Watson, who moved to Chalford Hill, Stroud, as a new mum and used the Old Neighbourhood as a hub to connect with other parents.Now a Stroud district councillor representing the area, she has joined a campaign group fighting to stop the landlord's plans to convert it into a residential property.The Old Neighbourhood has been deemed an asset of community value under the 2011 Localism Act, meaning local groups like the Chalford Hill Community Benefit Society must be given time to make a bid to buy it for the community. But, ultimately, the owner can reject it.""The asset of community value regulations are absolutely toothless. So any community that wants to keep their pub going is at the mercy of the markets,"" she said, adding the site is worth  300,000 more as housing than as a pub.Without outside support, community efforts to purchase closing pubs have a success rate of less than 10%, according to the Plunkett Foundation, a charity promoting community-owned businesses.""Sadly that picture is very recognisable,"" said CAMRA's Mr Stainer: ""It was recognisable pre-COVID and COVID has accelerated the process.""He added: ""I think a lot of property owners are being tempted to take the fast buck.""Pub companies often finance buying pubs in such a way that they need to make big returns to service the debts, which can either be done by raising rents or selling off parcels of land, he said.""It is the tenants and the pubs that suffer because they are the ones that get chucked out of their business and often their homes.""'Daily struggle' of doing businessThe last four years have been ""incredibly intense"" for the industry, said Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA).She lists off some of the ""thousand cuts"" Dr Thurnell-Read was referring to: the pandemic, war in Ukraine, pressures on supply chains, the energy crisis, cost inflation and customers who are far worse off that they were in 2019.Mr Goodman, of the Duke of Cumberland Arms in Henley, lists the impacts of these wounds: ""The price of food, alcohol, wages, electric, gas - it's never-ending.""He said: ""It is definitely the trickiest the industry has ever been, I think. It is a daily struggle.""Food costs, in particular, have been ""insane since the beginning of the year"", rising by at least 15%, and in some cases doubling since 2019.And they are completely unpredictable: ""The prices can just change overnight, quite drastically as well.""It's not just food. Despite wholesale energy costs easing, Ofgem research published in March found 88% of hotel and catering businesses were still concerned about the impact of energy prices on their business.Fixed energy contracts have come to an end at five Cornish pubs run by Chris Black and his husband Jason, who face new tariffs costing 25% to 50% more.""Pubs are not particularly energy efficient. I think that can be a massive factor in where money is basically being wasted quite easily,"" said Mr Black, 39.He went on to echo an argument being made across the industry: While world events may not be in the government's gift, taxation is, and pubs are being ""overly taxed"".""I don't think there has been enough done to support pubs and that's evident in the number of pubs that are closing,"" he said.Alcohol duty, a tax levied on booze, is worth approximately 54.2p in a pint of 5% ABV draught beer (38p in a 3.5% pint, 75.9p for 7%).Food and drink served in pubs is also subject to 20% VAT (though this was reduced to 5% and 12.5% at different stages of the pandemic).Pubs contribute 2.5% of all business rates collected by the government, but generate 0.5% of total business turnover, which CAMRA and the BBPA argue equates to a  500m overpayment.Taken together, Ms McClarkin estimates  1 in every  3 goes ""straight to the tax man"".COVID loans hangover and WFHDuring his research, Dr Thurnell-Read was told by many publicans they could have survived COVID or the cost of living crisis - but not both.The term perfect storm is overused, but for CAMRA's Mr Stainer, it's the only appropriate description.The pandemic burned through pubs' savings and forced them to take on more debt, just before the cost of energy and ingredients rose dramatically and the amount of money customers had to spend plummeted.Now, loans taken out and rents deferred during COVID are being called in, said Mr Stainer.""Many pubs have survived COVID but maybe are in danger of not surviving the long-term effects of the lockdown.""Introduced in March 2020, the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan was a scheme whereby the government would encourage banks to loan up to  5m to businesses by guaranteeing 80% of the money and paying any interest or fees for the first year.""It is definitely a contributing factor to these failures, the inability to be able to pay back these loans,"" said Ms McClarkin, of the BBPA.She said some smaller brewers had gone into administration because they ""simply cannot pay them back"".Loans aren't the only COVID hangovers facing pubs, according to Ms McClarkin: ""Working from home culture has definitely damaged the pub sector, to the point where some pubs simply don't open Monday, Tuesday.""The pub lunch has dwindled in cities and big towns, and some establishments are choosing to close early on weekdays and open earlier on weekends, she said, as customers switch to less frequent outings.Fewer, more costly staffStaffing has been a problem since Brexit, says Jane Pendlebury, chief executive of the Hospitality Professionals Association (HOSPA).She explained the end of freedom of movement had made it more difficult to find staff - and choose the right staff.""The friendliness, the smiles, charm, the willingness to pour a drink or deliver some food with a smile on your face will take them [pubs] a long way, but... if you can't get the right staff then you're not going to be delivering that.""Minimum wage increases, while great for workers, have added to the outgoings for struggling pubs, she said.April's increase ( 1.02- 1.26 more per hour for each employee) will see the sector's salary bills rise by  3.2bn, according to trade body UKHospitality.""People's wages have gone up, and that's absolutely acceptable and they should go up, but when it all adds up in this industry, when do you start going out and you're paying over  50 on a steak?"" said Mr Goodman, of the Duke of Cumberland Arms.Cornish publican Mr Black said: ""We've run a lot tighter on labour to try and keep the cost down because labour costs can be real money down the drain if you've got too many staff on at the wrong times.""ExhaustionFor HOSPA's Ms Pendlebury, it's important to remember pubs are run by people - and they have a limit.""People that run pubs, own pubs, are just exhausted.""They were enormously under pressure [during COVID] and then as the guests came back, they were more difficult to deal with because their expectations were so high.""So I think they are at their wits' end.""It's the smaller, more independent pubs that are closing, she said.The scale of pub companies means more favourable borrowing rates, supply-chain priority and better value for money when bulk buying stock like menus, cutlery and loo roll, she said.They may have their own property managers - rather than more costly local tradespeople - and staff to manage their online reputation.""If it's all chains then we would, probably, ultimately lose some of our character as a country,"" said Ms Pendlebury.It's not all badWalk across the River Ver, St Albans, north of London, almost 1,000 years ago and you would have seen the same building where Ronan Gaffney serves pints today.Pop into Ye Olde Fighting Cocks for an ale 400 years ago, and you might even have bumped into Oliver Cromwell, who was said to have spent a night at the inn during the mid-1600s.But centuries of history could not save the pub in February 2022, when the Fighting Cocks, the only inn to be officially recognised as the oldest in Britain, closed (though this was a title so disputed in the industry that Guinness dropped the category entirely in 2000).Mr Gaffney, 27, and his colleagues lost their jobs in the pub where he - and generations before him - bought his first pint.But this isn't the story of another lost community asset: the pub reopened two months later, and Mr Gaffney was there to welcome the community back -

03-09-2024,SkyNews,Business,New wind projects a good first step for government - but big challenges remain,"It takes more than half an hour by helicopter from Hull to get to the world's largest offshore wind farm 60 miles off the East Yorkshire coast.Hornsea 2 is vast, 30 miles long and 10 miles wide, but it's about to get a whole lot bigger.As part of the government's auction of renewable energy ""contracts for difference"" Orsted, the Danish offshore wind developer, has secured funding for two new projects - Hornsea 3 and Hornsea 4 - more than doubling the size of the wind zone.It's good news for Orsted and other wind developers.Last year, partly as a result of high inflation and supply chain costs, no projects managed to secure government backing.And it's a success for the government too.Labour campaigned on a promise to lower bills and deliver a zero-carbon electricity system by 2030. This latest auction was the first major test of their progress towards that target.New Shetland wind farm could power 500,000 homesOfgem approves Britain's biggest single grid investment for 'electricity super highway'GB Energy: The burning question facing ministers on UK-owned clean powerOverall it secured nearly 5GW (gigawatts) of new offshore wind capacity.Importantly, a contract was awarded for Greenvolt, one of the world's largest floating offshore wind projects.Compared with fixed offshore wind projects like Hornsea it's small - just 0.4GW.But sitting in deep water 50 miles off Aberdeen, it will be an early test of a technology that could allow more wind farms in more convenient locations around the UK.The government has said it wants the new state-owned power business, GB Energy, to pioneer floating offshore wind as a technology it can export worldwide - boosting the UK economy.The auction also secured nearly 5GW of new solar, onshore wind and tidal generation projects.It's a good first step for the government, but it still leaves a 20GW gap to get to its target of 55GW of offshore wind generation by 2030.If it can deliver on the pledge, however, it should be good news for consumers.Though ""contracts for difference"" are ultimately funded through customers' bills, the expectation is that once more renewable energy is on the grid, it should bring long-term savings for consumers.The extreme price spikes we have experienced in recent years have been due to the volatile price of natural gas.The less of that we need to burn for electricity, the cheaper our bills will be.Trade organisation RenewableUK said power generated by this year's newly commissioned projects would save consumers nearly  3bn a year compared to the alternative cost of gas by 2030.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeRead more from Sky News:New Shetland wind farm could power 500,000 homesDrax agrees to pay  25m for misreporting data on wood it burnsBut securing more renewable generation is only part of the challenge.The variable nature of wind and solar power means the UK will need the ability to store that excess power for days when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing.Those technologies - like batteries or using spare electricity to make and store hydrogen gas - will need to scale massively.So too will connections on the national grid to move power from remote sites - many in Scotland and the North Sea - to homes where it is needed.This is a good start for the government, but there are strong headwinds to overcome.",https://news.sky.com/story/new-wind-projects-a-good-first-step-for-government-but-big-challenges-remain-13208884

He is also being investigated for allegedly refusing to share information and documents with investigators.Representatives for Telegram have said the company abides by EU laws and its moderation is in line with industry standards.The company added in a statement: ""It is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner is responsible for abuse of that platform.""Read moreWho is the Telegram founder?Durov's arrest works to Russia's advantageZuckerberg claimed White House 'pressured' MetaBe the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeDurov's arrest had other tech bosses up in arms.

29-08-2024,SkyNews,Business,Challenge for Starmer to turn warm words with EU into economic wins for UK ,"Parliament is yet to return, but Sir Keir Starmer has used the last few days of August to frame the next few months of his premiership.First, there was the bad news - his warning from the Downing Street garden that things are going to get a lot worse before they get better, with ""painful"" decisions in the shape of tax rises and spending cuts on the way this autumn.Second, was his attempt to inject some hope into his project and make good on that election message of change - with a visit to Berlin to talk up a ""once in a generational chance"" to ""turn the corner on Brexit"".Politics live: New treaty 'very scant on detail'The vehicle for a speech of optimism in the gloom came in the shape of a bilateral treaty between the UK and Germany, who are negotiating to deepen security, defence and trade ties.It would be the first of its kind between the UK and its biggest trading partner in Europe, and watching the rapport between Chancellor Schloz and the prime minister, it was clear that there was much goodwill and common ground between these two leaders.As the German premier said at their joint press conference in Berlin: ""I am happy about the announcement by Keir Starmer to seek a reset in the relations to the European Union. We want to take this hand which is reached out to us.""Starmer wants reset with EU - 'but that does not mean reversing Brexit'Adam Boulton: Bank holiday travellers beware - getting to and from Europe is about to get a whole lot harderSir Keir Starmer says work is under way for closer ties with EU and to fix UK's 'botched' Brexit dealKeep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsBoth sides want to wrap up the deal by the end of the year, with whispers Sir Keir will be back in the German capital sooner rather than later to sign off on the treaty.It will be seen and sold as a political win and a reset in Anglo-German relations, undoubtedly strained by Brexit.The two leaders spoke about a new framework they were working on to better co-ordinate on illegal migration - Sir Keir has long talked about the supply of small boats coming through Germany.They also spoke of deepening trade and security ties, as well as cultural and societal ones.There was a nod to collaboration on energy and supply chains - Sir Keir visited a Siemens energy factory after the news conference, while Number 10 said it wanted an ""ambitious agreement"" to ""deepen market access"".Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerBut there is an obvious elephant in the room. On the one hand, Sir Keir really wants to fulfil his number one mission for government - to become the fastest growing economy in the G7 and take this once-in-a-generation chance to reset relations with European partners.On the other, this is a prime minister who is insistent there will be no unravelling of Brexit, having ruled out re-entering the European Union, single market or customs union in his lifetime.It is obvious Germany, France, or any country that is part of the single market, cannot access bilateral trade deals - that is the point of being in the EU trading bloc. So is this just all a lot of warm words and hot air?Because meaningful improvements in any trade deal will involve concessions. One big ask from Germany - in effect repeated by Chancellor Schloz at the press conferences - is for a youth mobility scheme between the UK and other European countries.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeWhen I asked Sir Keir about this at the press conference, he explicitly ruled it out, telling me: ""We do not have plans for the youth mobility scheme, but we do have plans for a closer relationship between us and the EU.""He later told reporters he did not rule out setting up some sort of system for other link-ups, for example, student exchanges. Freedom of movement is still a red line, but time-limited exchanges are perhaps not.This matters because it gets to the meat of what a closer relationship looks like. If the prime minister wants to change warm words into real action, there will need to be concessions, and on Wednesday Chancellor Schloz was clearly laying out one such possible deal.There are, UK officials tell me, things the two countries can do, such as easing UK access to German markets by, for example, creating beneficial arrangements so regulatory barriers are removed and British companies are able to be part of tender processes.But this is tinkering at the edges rather than real reform.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerThere are plenty back home who will argue that if Sir Keir really wants a reset he should look again at Brexit, because this would be a tangible way of removing trade barriers and going for the economic growth that underpins his entire project. But on this, the prime minister says he will not budge.By the end of the year, we will have a far better sense of what Sir Keir can achieve with a change of tone, if not substance, in the shape of the first bilateral treaty between Germany and the UK.But at the moment, it's hard to see how he turns those warm words into real wins for the UK economy.",https://news.sky.com/story/challenge-for-starmer-to-turn-warm-words-with-eu-into-economic-wins-for-uk-13204922

Since then, seven successive Tory chancellors, from George Osborne to Jeremy Hunt, kept it, even in the Conservatives' austerity years.But Ms Reeves would do well to heed the lessons from Mr Brown's own blunder in 1999 when he increased the state pension by a derisory 75p and was forced into a humiliating U-turn.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerAfter Sir Keir's ""short-term pain for long-term-good"" appeal this week, Labour's chief cheerleader in Fleet Street, the Daily Mirror, declared in its leader column: ""It's time for a fuel U-turn.""Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire revealed the paper's postbag was ""bulging"" and wrote: ""This is a moment for Starmer and Reeves to heed Denis Healey's first law of politics, which was for those in a hole to stop digging.""So what's the lesson, then, for the chancellor and prime minister from the twin assault she's facing, on tax and fuel bills?It's surely that the evidence from polls and postbags is the public will put up with some tax rises for the better off in so-called ""Middle England"".But tales of freezing pensioners this Christmas won't go down well with voters.

01-09-2024,SkyNews,Ents & Arts,Sing Sing star Clarence Maclin served time in a maximum security prison. What he found there could potentially take him to the Oscars,"""No one wants to voluntarily walk back into a situation like prison. Once that chapter is over and done, you want to put that behind you, start your life over. But there was a message that needed to get out.""Clarence Maclin spent years of his life at the Sing Sing correctional facility, a maximum security prison in Ossining, New York state, serving a long sentence for robbery. Six years in, he stumbled across a group that would change his life.The Rehabilitation Through The Arts (RTA) programme is now the subject of the film Sing Sing, starring Oscar nominees Colman Domingo and Paul Raci - alongside Maclin and other formerly incarcerated men who discovered hidden talents for acting inside the prison's walls.Before joining, Maclin was feared by other men in the prison, and guarded himself. Vulnerability is not something you show in jail. But something about this group flicked a switch.""I was caught up in the stereotypes of what I'm supposed to be,"" he says now, talking to Sky News on Zoom. ""I look like I should be playing basketball or football.""He tried to hone his basketball skills, but sport was never his forte. ""I'm better at art, but back then I suppressed that. I came across RTA and unlocked it.""In Sing Sing, he revisits his former life to play a modified version of himself - feared by others, extorting money from seemingly ""weaker"" men, and selling drugs. After coming across the programme, Maclin had to keep his prison record clear of infractions for a year before being accepted, but was determined to do so.The film focuses on the true story of Divine G Whitfield (played by Domingo), a man who also found the programme after being imprisoned at Sing Sing for a crime he did not commit.'We're a lot more than what you may think of us'Learning to act in prison, with ""poor acoustics, poor sound system"", Maclin had been taught for the stage - to be ""overdramatic"", he laughs. Domingo helped him rein that in.""[In prison] I have to use my instrument to make sure the guy in the last seat can hear me speak,"" he says, enunciating as if on stage. ""When you're dealing with just that camera right there, it's all right to bring it in.""After leaving prison, Maclin has worked as a youth counsellor, creative arts specialist, and gang intervention specialist working with vulnerable boys. He is also an RTA consultant and an executive producer of Sing Sing.There was ""a lot of apprehension"" about playing his former self. But he wants people to see the value of RTA, the transformative power of the arts.""We're a lot more than whatever you may think of us from viewing the movies or TV or news,"" he says. ""We need to show there's a segment of population in every prison that is not a part of violence and not a part of the corruption, that are genuinely trying to make themselves better people and be better prepared when they come home, back into society.""He pauses. ""I'm not saying those violent things and those corrupt things that go on inside those type of institutions are not there. I'm just saying that that's not all that's there.""His co-star Domingo is known for films such as the civil rights biopic Rustin and The Color Purple, both released last year, as well as his Emmy-winning performance in the HBO series Euphoria.However, he started out in educational theatre, in schools ""stripped of art"". He knows the impact it can have, he says, which is why, despite having less than three weeks between finishing The Color Purple and working on extra scenes for Rustin, he said yes to filming Sing Sing in between.""I really thought I needed a break, so it had to be something very special,"" he tells Sky News on a separate call. ""But it felt like there was a pulse happening around the film... I went there to do the work that is about healing, and I think I gained so much more.""How drama helped the inmates of Sing SingDomingo didn't know much about the RTA programme before he started. ""What I learned was, in this prison, this place where it actively can be a very dangerous place, especially dangerous when it comes to matters of the heart, and feeling vulnerable... it feels like an act of joyous disobedience to have a practice of theatre.""He could see how it had helped the men who had joined. ""They never used this word, but I truly did recognise they were exhibiting incredible amounts of tenderness with each other, which is also revolutionary.""The statistics speak for themselves, he says, citing a figure which is highlighted by producers: while the national rate for people returning to prison in the US after incarceration was higher than 60%, fewer than 5% of RTA graduates return. ""It shows the arts work.""It was important to Domingo to show male friendship, platonic relationships, in a way that is not often portrayed on screen. Especially, he says, ""depictions of black and brown men that are sort of smashing tropes that were just filled with toxic masculinity"".The real Divine G Whitfield, he says, is ""kind of shy... very bookish"". He called himself a ""jailhouse lawyer"" due to the time he spent in the library, reading up, advocating for himself and others.""He was someone who still had hope,"" says Domingo. ""The idea of knowing someone who was on the inside and wrongly accused of a crime, serving time for something he didn't commit; that he still had hope gave me everything I needed to know how to play him.""Critics and viewers have praised the film. Its ""commitment to the truth of its characters - and of life itself - is rare and precious,"" says the Roger Ebert review, while Deadline describes it as ""a beacon of hope"". Many viewers have been left in tears by the performances, the real-life stories of these men.""In this very polarising time, everywhere in the world, we're looking for moments to say we're connected and we're human, and you don't have to be a product of what you were made up to be, or what someone thought you were,"" says Domingo. ""You can be different...""When people are saying they sat there and sobbed and couldn't get up from the movie theatre... I think it's touched them somewhere deeply. It's touched their humanity and made us feel more human again.""'If you look around, you may find somebody just like me'Domingo is already receiving Oscars buzz for what would be his second consecutive best actor nomination. Maclin too, in his debut on-screen performance, is appearing on predictions shortlists for best supporting actor.""Incredible,"" he says. He never imagined the film would be received in this way.""We didn't think of it as having a longevity. I thought this was something that you put on your bucket list and you get it done: 'All right, well, I did it, I did my bucket list.' Now this has turned into a career opportunity... it's more than a movie now, it's a movement. It's a real amazing feeling.""Read more from Sky News entertainment:Wu-Tang Clan star pivots to balletTim Burton on 'chaotic' Beetlejuice sequelKeep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsMore than an Oscar nomination, though, Maclin hopes the film will change perceptions. ""For the brothers locked in, still inside, my message to them is: we are a lot more than what they call us - but we're going to have to own it. We're going to have to take it upon ourselves and not wait for the department of corrections to correct our behaviour; we got to correct our own behaviour and come back out here and be positive people in society.""And for anyone watching the film, those learning for the first time about the RTA and its graduates' stories, he says: ""I would like for people to leave the cinema knowing there are good people in bad circumstances... that if you look around, you may find a 'me' - somebody just like me, somebody in need of a little compassion, a little empathy, somebody in need of a little hope. And if you can find it within you to pour a little bit of hope into somebody, I'm quite sure you'll find a better individual.""Sing Sing is out in cinemas in the UK and Ireland now",https://news.sky.com/story/sing-sing-star-clarence-maclin-served-time-in-a-maximum-security-prison-what-he-found-there-could-potentially-take-him-to-the-oscars-13205411
27-08-2024,SkyNews,Ents & Arts,"Oasis reunion: It felt like it might never happen - now, finally, the Gallagher brothers are back","Listening to Noel Gallagher over the years, for a long time it didn't feel like this was part of the masterplan.He has spoken several times of the difficult decision he made to quit Oasis in 2009. The band was his life and the choice not made lightly, but ending things then was the best thing for everyone, he told Sky Arts a few years ago. The fact they didn't continue was a big part of the reason they are now ""up there with all the greats"".The older Gallagher brother was well aware the years apart - the brothers' often funny but frustrating feud, the unanswered question of whether they would ever bury the hatchet and the hope that maybe, one day, it might just happen - all amplified their legend.Rumours have come and gone over the years, propelled in no small part by messages from Liam Gallagher on social media. He often teased, but never made any secret of wanting to bring Oasis back. The sticking point seemed to be Noel.But in 2022, Liam played gigs at Knebworth - the site of Oasis's most famous, history-making gigs. Earlier this year, he got in early to mark the anniversary of their debut album Definitely Maybe with his own solo tour, no sign of the man who wrote the songs.Noel created the music, Liam brings it snarlingly, viscerally alive. Him doing these shows alone felt like it could be a death knell for a reunion. When asked about Liam by a fan during one of his shows with his current band, the High Flying Birds, only a few weeks ago, Noel reportedly said his younger brother should be ""thankful for my genius"" and told the crowd: ""Just remember who wrote all the f***ing songs.""'They hadn't spoken in goodness knows how long'Even the new artwork for Definitely Maybe (pictured above), released for the 30th anniversary this week, shows a reworking of that famous album cover - shot at guitarist Bonehead's house in Manchester - this time with the band members absent from the room. With no Liam on the floorboards, no Noel staring up at the spinning globe, it felt like a statement: Oasis really have left the building.Designer Brian Cannon, who worked on the artwork for all of Oasis's early music and now runs the Microdot memorabilia stores, says he was as surprised as anyone by the reunion announcement.""A lot of people say to me, it's all a big marketing ploy,"" he says, of the brothers' fall-out. ""No, it isn't, they genuinely hadn't spoken to each other for goodness knows how long. And Noel's got a very successful solo career that he's very content with and doing very well. I didn't see this coming, I really didn't.""Photographer Michael Spencer Jones, who captured the images for all the Oasis albums and singles in the band's heyday, says the sibling rivalry was always there. ""It's such a major part of the potion that was Oasis.""Read more:Cool Britannia: Life in the UK in the '90sA timeline of Britpop's most successful bandBut there have been whispers for months now, reports from industry insiders saying it was only a matter of time. In January 2023, Noel announced his separation from his now ex-wife Sara MacDonald, who did not get on with Liam, leading to speculation he might become more open to making amends.More recently, following reports of shows booked for Wembley, fans have once again pointed to teases from Liam on social media - ""I never did like that word FORMER"" he posted on Sunday morning - and a recent interview given by Noel in which he spoke in complimentary terms about his little brother's voice: ""When I'd sing a song it would sound good. When he'd sing it, it would sound great.""Neither of these things made a reunion a certainty. While Noel may not have liked his brother at times, he never underestimated the shared power their bristling sibling rivalry brought to Oasis. ""I wouldn't have gotten anywhere without him, he wouldn't have got anywhere without me,"" he told journalists at an awards ceremony in 2019.'The stars have aligned' - but statement gives little awayOasis in their heyday were like no other live band. The shows were electrifying, the energy raw, in an era of optimism and fun in the 1990s that the Gallagher brothers defined. In later years, Noel may not have been a fan of the Cool Britannia tag, but that's exactly what it was.So now, will this reunion just be about the gigs? Will there be new music? Could the Gallagher brothers even be friends again?The reunion statement gives little away. ""The guns have fallen silent. The stars have aligned. The great wait is over. Come see. It will not be televised."" Further details say there was ""no great revelatory moment"", but rather ""the gradual realisation that the time is right"" - but the Gallaghers have not really addressed the fact they haven't been on speaking terms for years. We want to know who reached out first? How did they finally come to an agreement? And what did their mum, Peggy, say about her sons finally getting their acts together?Whatever has happened behind the scenes, the frost has definitely thawed. In 2020, Liam said Oasis had been offered  100m to reform - a claim quickly denied by Noel, who suggested the remark was a publicity move to promote a single. The deal they have signed now will undoubtedly be worth megabucks. But even before the announcement was made, Liam was quick to put anyone suggesting this was only about the money in their place.""Your attitude stinks,"" was his reply to anyone questioning the motives. Positivity received a different response. ""Your attitude is BIBLICAL.""You only have to look at the crowds at Liam's solo shows - full of teenagers, as well as those of us who were there the first time round in the 1990s - to see how the music has filtered through generations. The singer has said several times he would like younger fans to see the full Oasis live experience.Read more:'Everyone was out of control in the '90s'The 'unsolvable conundrum' of Oasis's biggest albumBe the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeNow, they just have to deliver.""There's two schools of thoughts on this and at one time I would have fallen into the latter,"" says Cannon. ""One being: great, yes, fantastic. The second: no, leave it be, let it lie, it's gone, you might tarnish the past.""But. We're living through strange times in this country at the minute, globally as well. There's a lot of division, recent events have been quite shocking. [A reunion] will undoubtedly bring a lot of happiness to a lot of people and I'm all in favour of a lot of people being happy. So, yeah, it's got to be a good thing.""""There should be an album, I think,"" says Spencer Jones. ""It would be great if there was more music to come.""Next year marks the 30th anniversary of their second album, (What's The Story) Morning Glory? Both Noel and Liam will be well aware of the expectation, how much these shows mean to fans. Get them wrong, and there's the potential for the legacy, the memories, to be spoiled.Get them right, and Oasis live forever all over again.",https://news.sky.com/story/oasis-reunion-it-felt-like-it-might-never-happen-now-finally-the-gallagher-brothers-are-back-13203769

And because it always seems quite cynical and calculating the decisions she's made, to have the biggest boobs and to make that her job.""But the writer of Toxic, Women, Fame And The Noughties says there is a glass ceiling concealed within Price's unconventional career choice.""Over time you run up to the limits of what's possible. You can't get bigger and bigger and bigger indefinitely - eventually someone's going to come along and be even bigger or have even more recklessly huge implants.""Ditum says she's long been intrigued by Price, who she first saw on a poster on a younger male relative's bedroom wall.""It was interesting that someone had worked out how to turn her body into a business and how to get longevity out of being a Page 3 girl, because this was a time when Page 3 was contentious.""And she says Price was a rare victor in the cut-throat world of glamour modelling.""Katie Price was almost unique in that she came up through Page 3, and she found longevity in her career. That was what Page 3 was meant to be - the sell was always 'this is an opportunity for working-class girls to make their way in the world and use their assets'. That was the fig leaf of it. She was the only person who really achieved it and I found that compelling.""Ditum goes on: ""She's obviously smart. If you look at what Page 3 does to girls, it was a machine for taking teenagers and getting naked pictures of them, and that's it - then sifting them out when they got too old. The lifespan of a Page 3 girl was tiny, and the number of them who achieved any kind of ongoing success out of that was infinitesimal, and she was one of them.""That does not happen if you are dumb. She's very intelligent at seeking publicity, she's very intelligent at shaping her profile, and she's very intelligent at using her body and using the extremity of her body to attract attention.""But the cost of doing that is personally and physically really unimaginably huge. And there's no long-termism built into it.""Katie becomes JordanBorn Katrina Amy Alexandra Alexis Infield in Brighton in 1978, Price (who took her surname from her stepfather) was a keen swimmer and equestrian.Riding since the age of seven, she would go on to perform dressage at the Horse of the Year Show in 2008, entering the ring to Peter Andre's Mysterious Girl. It was certainly not a foreseeable trajectory from Price's early career choices.She began modelling as a teen, but it was her appearance on Page 3 of The Sun in 1996, billed as Jordan and aged just 18, that made her a household name.A savvy marketeer, she chose the name Jordan as she thought it sounded catchier than Katie - and she was right. It was an alter ego which would stay with her until she re-branded as Katie Price eight years later.Frequently appearing in the popular lads' mags of the late 90s and early 2000s, she was a staple in the tabloid press and celebrity magazines and featured in both the UK and US editions of Playboy, making the cover in the American edition.Four years later she would undergo the first of many breast enhancements - going from her natural 32B to a 32C. A year later she'd have two more operations. A professional lifestyle choice, boob jobs would go on to punctuate her career.Price has gone both up and down in size over the years, her largest being 2120 cubic centimetre implants in 2022 (that's three times bigger than a standard E cup), before a slight reduction again this year. She says she has had 17 boob jobs to date.When asked in a 2009 Sunday Times interview if she'd ever consider having a facelift, she was adamant she wouldn't, saying: ""I've seen them in LA, they look like freaks.""She's softened her attitude since then, undergoing multiple facial procedures, but insisting she held off until she was into her 40s (she's now 46).Her sister Sophie has called her love of cosmetic surgery ""a form of self-harm,"" while her mother Amy has said her oldest daughter suffers from body dysmorphia, a mental health condition the NHS notes can cause a person to spend a lot of time worrying about perceived flaws in their appearance.Price herself told the Go Love Yourself! podcast last year: ""I've never thought I'm good-looking, and I still don't. Maybe I've got body dysmorphia, and [maybe] I have to admit I've got body dysmorphia because I'm always changing stuff. And I know sometimes when I've gone too far.""She went on to say she doesn't know ""what goes on in my head with me and my body"", admitting she's trying to achieve ""something that's probably not possible"".Last year, Price said she'd been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a condition which according to the NHS can affect people's behaviour and can lead sufferers to act on impulse.Reality TV re-inventionBack in 2004, Price was already well-known to the public thanks to her regular appearances in the press.She'd dated a series of low-level stars - Gladiator Ace, Another Level singer Dane Bowers, Pop Idol singer Gareth Gates to name but a few - and was regularly photographed out and about in the fashionable bars and clubs of London.Ready for the next step in her career, it was her appearance on I'm A Celebrity that would transform her from a tabloid regular into a TV reality star - along with all the attention and fame that would come along with it.Natalka Znak - a TV executive dubbed the queen of reality TV thanks to her creation of prime-time hits including I'm A Celebrity, Love Island and Hell's Kitchen - says she jumped at the chance to get Price on I'm A Celeb back in 2004.Now the CEO of three TV production companies, Znak tells Sky News: ""I was always a massive fan of Katie, and I was super keen for her to be on the show.""She calls Price ""a classic good tabloid booking"", explaining: ""You hadn't seen lots of her back then, she was a Page 3 model, so you hadn't seen her looking down and dirty, so it was interesting.""A multi-BAFTA winner herself, Znak knows TV magic when she sees it.""She was good to work with because she worked hard and she was always great on camera. You'd turn a camera on her and she was instantly watchable.""We've dealt with a lot of difficult people, and I don't think she was particularly difficult.""A recognisable name, Price wasn't a cheap booking. Znak can't remember the exact amount, but admits, ""we paid a lot of money for her"", adding that she was the highest-paid contestant to appear on the show at the time.It was an outlay that was immediately reflected in the viewing figures.Znak says: ""I remember the instant boost in ratings. That series they were through the roof. It just worked. It was worth it ""A lot of it was to do with having her on it. She was a really important part of it. And she was fantastic.""The third series of the show was one of the most watched series to date, with viewing figures almost hitting 12 million (for comparison, last year's viewing average was 7 million).Znak says: ""That show was such a huge hit. And then she went on to build a big career off the back of it.""Price and Andre: 'It was for real'Kerry Katona won I'm A Celeb that year, with Price coming in fifth place. But a key part of that year's drama was built around Price's relationship with Peter Andre.The high-profile relationship, which flourished in front of millions of viewers, led to a four-year marriage, and two children.Znak went to the wedding - which was complete with a Cinderella glass carriage, six white horses and puffy pink dress - and describes the 2005 Highclere Castle ceremony as ""fantastic"".Quite the golden couple, the wedding shots were sold to OK! for  2m. A succession of ITV docuseries would go on to chart their family life - up to their divorce in 2009.But was it all faked for the cameras? Not according to Znak.She says: ""Nobody was expecting it. She had a boyfriend at the time. On the show everyone was like, 'Is it for real?' But it was for real.""I was really sad when they split up, it was a shame. He was really good for her. I think she was totally in love with him.""Znak says while she'd like to take credit for the TV gold that resulted from the surprise coupling, it was as much a shock to her as everyone else, and ""absolutely not planned"".""They were such an unlikely match  It was just a compelling love story in the jungle.""Price would go on to appear in I'm A Celeb again in 2009. She was paid  450,000 for her appearance and chose to leave after just nine days, saying she was sick of repeatedly being voted to do the Bushtucker Trials by the public every night.And while never crowned Queen of the jungle, she did win Celebrity Big Brother in 2015, leaving Katie Hopkins languishing in the runner-up position.A Jack of all tradesNever short of an opinion - or shy to share it - Price was part of ITV's Loose Women presenting line-up between 2015 and 2018, after previously appearing as a guest panellist.A best-selling author, Price's name also graces the cover of 11 rom-com novels, eight autobiographies, a fashion guide and two series of children's books.Indeed, her Perfect Pony series has turned her into an unlikely role model for horsey girls.But books aren't her only side-hustle.Short-lived political aspirations saw her stand as an independent candidate in Greater Manchester in the 2001 general election, campaigning on free boob jobs and no parking tickets. She was unsuccessful and secured just 713 votes.An aspiring singer too, she was runner-up in her quest to be the UK's 2005 Eurovision act, and released an album the following year, a collaboration with ex-husband Peter Andre.Indeed, over the years, she's also tried her hand as a chat show host, columnist and fashion designer, as well as venturing into merchandise including perfume, nutritional supplements, and an equestrian clothing range.She also fronted her own fitness DVD and had a brief taste of Hollywood stardom with a cameo in Sharknado 5 (where she was inevitably eaten by a shark).In 2022 Price joined over 18s subscription service OnlyFans, currently charging fans  12 per month for access to her page with additional content available for an extra fee.Last year, she hit back at claims she wasn't making much money from her content, telling a podcast she had earned tens of thousands, while American gaming review platform Bonus Insider previously estimated she earned $2.2m a month from the X-rated site.Other ventures include a make-up line, a soap and scent business (Scented by Katie Price), a private Instagram page selling ""official Katie Price memorabilia"" and a Depop page selling off her old clothes, club appearances and make-up masterclasses.Price is nothing if not adaptable. And hardworking. As TV exec Znak summarises: ""She was always a grafter in my experience... She realised she had to work hard to succeed.""Price's latest venture is into the on-trend world of podcasting, co-presenting a weekly show with her younger sister Sophie.During one recent edition, Price mentioned that a three-part Netflix series about her life was in the works, however, Netflix told Sky News they had no plans to make such a documentary.A wife, a mother and a campaignerOften in the headlines for her high-profile relationships, Price has been married three times.After her relationship with Peter Andre came to an end, Price married cage fighter Alex Reid in 2010. It lasted less than two years but still spawned its own reality series.That was followed by a five-year marriage to former stripper Kieran Hayler in 2013. And she's currently dating Married At First Sight UK star JJ Slater.As Ditum explains: ""It's a tough one if you're in a business where romance is saleable, which certainly she was for a while. Her celebrity, her position on the cover of Heat magazine, would often rely on her having an interesting partner to be linked with.""Celebrities make decisions on how much of their personal life and your public life are combined, and in her case they're very closely combined, really intricately entwined.""Price is also a mother-of-five.Her first child, Harvey, whose father is ex-footballer Dwight Yorke was born in 2002, and suffers from autism, vision-impairing septo-optic dysplasia and the rare genetic disease Prader-Willi syndrome.As a parent of a disabled son, Price has frequently used her celebrity to shine a light on the challenges of living with a disabled child and has made several documentaries about Harvey with the BBC.She's also campaigned for law change around online abuse after Harvey became the target of online trolls. Sadly, Price has had plenty of practise at fighting back against cruel jibes aimed at her and her son from both the media and fellow celebrities.In 2007, Heat magazine published a sticker mocking a then five-year-old Harvey, brandishing the message: ""Harvey wants to eat me."" The publication later apologised for the stunt.And in 2010, Scottish comedian Frankie Boyle aimed two off-colour jokes at the then eight-year-old Harvey on Channel 4 show Tramadol Nights.Price called his jokes ""vile"", while Boyle has stood by his work and never apologised.Ditum says due to Price's background, her campaigning may not always have been given the recognition it deserves.""She's this kind of weird figure where she's famous for being a sexual celebrity, but she has this second life as a children's book author and she is also dealing publicly with being the mother of a disabled son.""At a minimum, she did some valuable work in terms of bringing understanding to families with disabled children... and that's not nothing.""Price is also mum to Junior, 19, Princess, 17, Jett, 11 and Bunny, 10.'Slow, sad late-career period'Legal and financial issues have plagued Price in recent years.In 2021 Price received a 16-week suspended sentence after flipping her car while under the influence of alcohol and cocaine, during which time she said she was suffering from a breakdown.In 2022 she was spared a prison sentence after breaching a restraining order forbidding her from contacting her ex-husband, Kieran Hayler's, fianc e.This year she was declared bankrupt due to an unpaid tax bill worth more than  750,000.Earlier this month she was arrested in Heathrow after failing to show up at a bankruptcy court hearing last month. She was returning from Turkey where she'd been undergoing cosmetic surgery.Each of her court dates attracts an inevitable media circus and press coverage of the latest chapter in her life.Price's lacklustre financial management and habit of poor choices have led to much negative media coverage in recent years.It's a trend Znak says is down to more than just the model's questionable conduct: ""There's always been a snobbery about her, which was something I never felt because she was just a hard-working woman earning money.""She's always been very ambitious and driven, and she carved out an incredible career for herself out of sheer determination.""Znak says gender bias also plays a role in some of the negativity around the star.""People are judgmental about women in a way they wouldn't be about men. Men are allowed to be successful and then not successful and then be successful again and reinvent themselves. But for women, there's a judgement that's applied.""With Price, she says that judgement can be particularly harsh because she doesn't play by anybody else's rules.""She was a role model for women, because even though she was a Page 3 model, she just always did everything her own f****** way.""From a more practical point of view, Ditum puts Price's ""long, slow, sad, late-career period"" down to a clear-cut decline in business.The author says it's ""not clear where you go and how much you can progress when your business is that kind of extreme treatment of your body"".And when your body is your business, your figure has more important figures attached to it than most.Ditum explains: ""The economy she comes out of, the soft porn economy, has really collapsed.""If you're someone like her, who could make pretty decent money out of selling calendars, and posters, and that kind of stuff that was your ancillary income if you were a model, that doesn't exist anymore. People do not go out and buy calendars of their favourite models.""Rising to fame ahead of the explosion of social media, the media landscape has now changed beyond all recognition.Ditum says whoever the equivalent of her poster-loving younger male relative is now, ""he's certainly not buying a Jordan poster or even buying a magazine - he's following models on Instagram"".She goes on: ""It's a really different economy and how you make money in that is pretty sketchy. It's challenging I think for a lot of people.""What Katie does next Price's career may have had meteoric ups and crushing downs, but the mark she's made on the celebrity world is undeniable.Whether a comeback is on the cards is hard to say, but as far as Price is concerned, her bucket list is already fully ticked off.Speaking to the Guardian earlier this year Price said: ""I wanted a big house in the countryside, a fairytale wedding, to be a famous pop star or a model, and to work with horses. I've achieved it all.""As for her future, Znak is optimistic: ""I would really hope that she could bounce back... She deserves it.""Never underestimate her, that's what I would say. People have done that all her life... but I have every faith in her, come on Katie!""Sky News has contacted Price for comment.",https://news.sky.com/story/katie-price-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-boundary-pushing-glamour-model-13191967

09-09-2024,SkyNews,Ents & Arts,Hollyoaks star Ali Bastian diagnosed with breast cancer,"Actress Ali Bastian says she has been diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer and is receiving chemotherapy ahead of a mastectomy and radiotherapy.The Hollyoaks star, who played teacher Becca Dean from 2001 to 2007, discovered a lump while breastfeeding her daughter, Isabella.Bastian, 42, told OK! magazine that ""it was a total shock"" when she was told the news in June, adding, ""I have mornings when I wake up and I've forgotten... and then suddenly I remember.

09-09-2024,SkyNews,Ents & Arts,London Film Festival 2024: Seven films to look out for at this year's LFF,"As film festival season gathers pace, the 68th BFI London Film Festival (LFF) has announced its full 2024 programme, featuring a whopping 39 world premieres.Angelina Jolie, Daniel Craig and Sir Elton John are among the stars to head up the 255-strong collection of movies from around the world.Here are seven LFF films to look out for - with some hotly tipped for the coming awards season.BlitzLondon-born director Steve McQueen opens the festival for the third time, with the world premiere of his World War Two drama Blitz. The movie re-creates a war-torn London, bombarded by nightly air raids, as battle rages all around.Saoirse Ronan stars as Rita, an East End mother who makes the heartbreaking decision to send her young son George, played by newcomer Elliott Heffernan, to safety in the countryside. But, George has other ideas, and is determined to return home despite the many dangers ahead.The ensemble cast includes Kathy Burke, Benjamin Clementine, Harris Dickinson and Stephen Graham, with a score by Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer.Amy Adams on her West End theatre debut in The Glass Menagerie - and getting hooked on Love IslandMariaAngelina Jolie makes a return to the big screen after several years away, starring in the biopic about famed opera singer Maria Callas, one of the greatest sopranos of all time.While the majority of the vocals we hear in the movie are from original recordings of Callas in her prime, the depictions of singing at the end of her life are mostly Jolie's own voice. The Oscar-winning actress, who spent seven months training for the role, has called it the most demanding of her career.Directed by Pablo Larrain, it depicts Callas's final days in Paris when she was addicted to anti-anxiety drugs, looking back to the peak of her career when she wowed audiences around the world. Larrain has said he hopes it will encourage people to listen to more opera.QueerBond star Daniel Craig plays a drug-addicted American living in 1950s Mexico, in the historical drama Queer.Based on the 1985 semi-autobiographical novel by Beat Generation author William Burroughs, the film delves into the nightlife of Mexico City, in an immersive flood of colour, and doesn't shy away from full-on sex scenes.With some reviewers praising it as Craig's best performance to date, it also stars Jason Schwartzman, Lesley Manville and newcomer Drew Starkey.NightbitchA comedy horror starring the ever-adaptable Amy Adams as a stay-at-home mother who slowly thinks she may be turning into a dog.Based on the 2021 novel by Rachel Yoder, it's pitched as a modern feminist fable, examining a society in which women are told they can ""have it all"".The movie is directed by Marielle Heller, who in 2020 was one of the female filmmakers many felt were snubbed by the Oscars and Golden Globes when she failed to get a nomination for her movie A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood. Heller will no doubt be hoping this film - as offbeat as it is - is a different story.The ApprenticeOne of the most polarizing political figures of the 21st century, this film unpacks the young Donald Trump, examining his life before politics, and his career in real estate in New York in the 1970s and 1980s.Directed by Iranian-Danish filmmaker Ali Abbasi, it stars Sebastian Stan stars as Trump, with Succession actor Jeremy Strong (aka Kendall Roy) playing attorney Roy Cohn.Possibly the most controversial film of the year, it's been beset with legal issues, not least of which include a cease-and-desist letter from Mr Trump's legal team.With a US election due in November, this one will at least be topical when it finally makes it to cinemas.TwiggyThis is the first fully approved documentary to tell British model Twiggy's life story.Directed by actor-turned-director Sadie Frost it tells the story of the fashion icon - whose real name is Lesley Lawson - going back to her working-class childhood in northwest London, through to her international stardom as a celebrity model, and her career as an actor, singer, fashion designer, writer and TV presenter.Other noteworthy documentaries screening at LFF include Elton John: Never Too Late, about the singer's final US live shows, and Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story, which looks back at the late actor's rise to fame as the superhero and his life following a horse-riding accident that left him paralysed from the neck down.Piece By PieceA movie about the life of musician Pharrell Williams will close the festival - but told entirely using Lego.Directed by Morgan Neville, and produced by Williams himself, it depicts the Happy singer's early life in Virginia, through to his rise to fame as he tops the charts.Williams recorded five new songs for the soundtrack, and many think it's a likely contender for best animated feature and best original song come awards season.LFF takes place from Wednesday 9 October to Sunday 20 October.",https://news.sky.com/story/london-film-festival-2024-seven-films-to-look-out-for-at-this-years-lff-13210239

08-09-2024,SkyNews,Ents & Arts,Liam Gallagher 'seriously gutted' over Oasis ticket chaos as fans join lottery for extra gigs,"Fans have started receiving invites to join a lottery to buy tickets for two extra Oasis concerts next year.It follows a major backlash over ticketing issues for the UK and Ireland gigs, which sold out in less than a day and triggered an investigation by competition watchdogs.A message posted on Oasis's X account said they would be sending the invites out to ""eligible fans we have been able to identify"" who were signed into a Ticketmaster account on Saturday 31 August - when tickets initially went on sale.Those who were able to join a queue for tickets ""may be eligible to take part"" and will receive an email on how to register for the ballot.Ticketmaster was widely criticised for dynamic pricing - a system used during high demand and limited supply - which caused the cost of a standard ticket to more than double from  148 to  355.The Competition and Markets Authority has asked for evidence from fans, including website screenshots during the buying process, as it examines concerns over whether the policy is fair.Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy also promised a government review and the European Commission said it would examine the issue too.Ticketmaster defended dynamic pricing and said concert prices are down to the ""event organiser"" who ""has priced these tickets according to their market value"".Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerBut dynamic ticket pricing has prompted strong criticism from other artists, including this year's Mercury Prize winner, English Teacher.Extra Wembley dates announcedFans were also furious after being left empty-handed, despite waiting in an online queue for hours.On Wednesday, Oasis announced they would play two more dates at Wembley Stadium on 27 and 28 September as part of next year's Live '25 tour using the new ticketing plan.In a statement, the band said they hoped the strategy would make ""the process far smoother for fans by reducing the stress and time it takes"" to obtain tickets.Read more from Sky News:Sir Elton back in public after severe eye infectionNicole Kidman leaves Venice after family emergencyMovies to look out for at London Film Festival 2024Meanwhile, Liam Gallagher has been speaking about his brother Noel.Liam will 'blow kisses' to Noel on stageDuring a series of messages on X he said he ""won't have a bad word said"" about him, and added he would be ""blowing him kisses in between each song"".He also addressed the chaos over ticketing: ""I'm seriously gutted for people that can't get tickets, I can't even go there it hurts my heart and I know people will think I'm taking the piss, but I'm not.""On Friday he had joked about the price of tickets.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsLiam talks setlist for reunion gigsReplying to one fan who was kicked off Ticketmaster's website while trying to buy tickets for the band's Cardiff gig, Liam replied: ""If that's what happened I'm sure someone will be in touch coz that ain't cool, good luck.""Liam also gave away some details about their tracks for their reunion gigs, telling one fan Don't Go Away from their 1997 album Be Here Now was ""not on the list"".Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeFormed in the early 1990s, Oasis rose to fame with songs such as Supersonic, Cigarettes & Alcohol and Live Forever, before second album (What's The Story) Morning Glory gave them their first number one single, Some Might Say.",https://news.sky.com/story/liam-gallagher-seriously-gutted-over-oasis-ticket-chaos-as-fans-join-lottery-for-extra-gigs-13211439

""The level of greed is disgusting. No one should be allowed to do it.""The Irish star is of course referring to dynamic ticket pricing, the controversial music industry issue that has dominated headlines, social media discourse and even politics this week following the chaotic Oasis reunion sale.At this year's Mercury Prize ceremony, honouring the 12 best albums from the UK and Ireland, many of the shortlisted artists, as well as the winners, English Teacher, spoke out about the issue.CMAT, whose real name is Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson, is an Oasis fan who plans to go to three gigs next year. But she didn't pay dynamic pricing, she says, and believes the system should be banned.""Why is every venue in the UK closing down? Why is every single part of the music industry on its knees, but somebody is benefiting from [increased] ticket prices?""Because if I was to allow dynamic pricing on my tickets - which I never, ever, ever would, and I have fought against it for the past year - I wouldn't be getting that [money]. My management wouldn't.""CMAT continues: ""Where's this money going? Who's getting it? Because it's not benefiting anyone.""As an independent artist, she says she has maintained more input and control of decision making when it comes to setting prices - and the conversation about dynamic pricing has ""reared its ugly head"" every so often over the past year.However, the singer also believes there are artists ""pressured into it that either don't know any better, or don't actually have the power or the right to fight against it, because they're in some deal"" they cannot escape from.As for the inflated Oasis tickets that have already been sold? ""Realistically, [sellers] should be refunding people,"" she says.'There's economics and there's creativity'Oasis fans spent hours in virtual queues after the sale opened on Saturday - only for many to find that some tickets had more than doubled due to ""in demand"" pricing for the reunion tour.The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched an investigation into the Ticketmaster sale, saying it will look into concerns over how dynamic pricing may have been used, and whether or not buyers were given clear and timely information explaining prices could change.Oasis themselves have announced further gigs with a change to the way tickets are bought, with an ""invitation-only ballot ticket sale"" as ""a small step towards making amends"".The band deny being aware of the decision to use dynamic pricing.""I think there's very, very rarely any instances in history where a commercial venture and a creative, artistic venture have collaborated to the benefit of them both,"" says rapper Berwyn, another 2024 Mercury Prize shortlisted artist.""I think there's economics and there's creativity. They both contribute to culture but opposite ends of the spectrum. Oftentimes they meet in the middle and the conversation is very rarely a good one.""'It's not hit the jazz world yet'""I think putting that barrier to entry on to any kind of event or music, it doesn't really support inclusivity,"" says musician and producer corto.alto, shortlisted for his debut album Bad With Names.""Thankfully it's not hit the jazz world yet... although there were big headlines when I announced my tour as well, about dynamic pricing."" He laughs. ""Joking, there was not. But it's something I think has to be looked at, for sure.""""It makes it really inaccessible,"" says Lewis Whiting, from English Teacher. ""If you're selling a ticket for a price, it should stay like that.""Rapper Ghetts, shortlisted for the second time for his fourth album On Purpose, With Purpose, says he sees fans as family.

Some could be led to believe that there were no negative environmental impacts at all, the ASA said.In fact, Virgin Atlantic confirmed to the ASA that sustainable aviation fuel produced the same level of CO2 emissions during flight as traditional jet fuel.While the production cycle of SAF produces less carbon than regular aviation fuel, the emissions created in flight are still ""significant"", the ASA said.And producing SAF can still have wider environmental costs and trade-offs, the agency added.""Because of that, it's important that claims for sustainable aviation fuel spell out what the reality is so consumers aren't misled into thinking that the flight they are taking is greener than it really is,"" said the ASA's director of complaints and investigations Miles Lockwood.Warning to advertisersThe watchdog issued a warning to businesses seeking to promote their climate mitigation or environmentally friendly measures, saying it expected any claims to be backed up.Businesses ""need to be wary"" of using statements like ""100% sustainable"" or ""sustainable"" when advertising products and services, Mr Lockwood said.""Claiming that a product or service is sustainable creates an impression that it is not causing harm to the environment and for that reason we expect to see robust evidence that this is the case.""Virgin Atlantic's responseBe the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeA Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: ""We're committed to achieving net zero by 2050 and key to this will be using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is one of the most immediate levers to decarbonising long haul aviation.""SAF is a term used globally by industry and government for fossil-alternative aviation fuels that adhere to specific sustainability criteria.""While we are disappointed that the ASA has ruled in favour of a small number of complaints, we remain committed to open, accurate and transparent engagement on the challenge of decarbonisation.""",https://news.sky.com/story/blow-to-airline-environmental-claims-as-virgin-atlantics-first-transatlantic-sustainable-aviation-fuel-ad-banned-13192093

13-07-2022,SkyNews,Travel,Revealed: Airline where cancellations are 12 times more likely than on Ryanair,"Flights from Gatwick are more likely to have been cancelled so far this year than at any other major UK airport.The rate is 10 times worse than Stansted, the best-performing British hub.More than 3% of planned flights from Gatwick didn't take place, compared with 0.3% of those from Stansted, according to figures from air travel intelligence company OAG provided exclusively to Sky News.June was Gatwick's worst month this year - one in every 14 flights from the airport was cancelled.The data is supplied to OAG from airlines, government agencies and other sources, and a cancellation is defined as any flight that an airline published to operate and was not cancelled at least 48 hours before departure.A Gatwick Airport spokesperson said it regrets any cancellations and disruption to passengers - and explained it is going to carefully increase capacity over the coming months ""so that airlines fly more reliable flight programmes and passengers experience a better standard of service"".It said this would help both airlines and ground handling companies, which are employed by airlines, in reducing the number of flights they need to manage.Which airlines have cancelled most flights?Ryanair was the best-performing major airline worldwide - it has cancelled just 0.3% of flights so far this year.Michael O'Leary, CEO of the budget carrier, has said that his company saw the recovery coming and got staff back early, and pointed out that as they were based in Ireland they were still able to benefit from frictionless European labour where this became more difficult for UK-based airlines following Brexit.British Airways is the worst-performing UK airline. At 3.5%, you are over 12 times more likely to have had a BA flight cancelled than a Ryanair one if you were expecting to fly in the first six months of 2022.This data covers flights up to 10 July and doesn't include the further 10,300 cancellations announced by the company, affecting flights due to take off before the end of October.Globally, China Eastern, based out of Shanghai, has been by far the worst affected, a product of the severe lockdown in the city from March onwards.A BA spokesperson attributed some of the problems to major storms in February, when one in seven of its flights was cancelled in a week-long period, the peak for the year. It also suffered an IT fault at the end of March, which coincided with one-tenth of flights being cancelled at short notice.The airline also highlighted increased exposure to global factors such as the Russian war in Ukraine and continuing COVID restrictions in Asia, compared with the likes of easyJet and Ryanair who only fly within Europe.The figures show that, during the peak of the pandemic in 2020, easyJet was the worst-affected global airline.It cancelled more than 50% of its 200,000 scheduled flights that year, and more than 99% of all flights that were meant to take off in April 2020.A spokesperson from the company said ""the UK government had the most onerous and long running travel restrictions in Europe and, as the UK's largest airline, we were disproportionately affected."" When there were fewer restrictions they said they were able to matched capacity very accurately to demand.Read more:Heathrow tells airlines to stop selling summer tickets and imposes passenger cap until SeptemberBritish Airways cancels 11% of flights during summer holiday peak to avoid airport disruptionOAG says consumers may have been blocked by airlines from booking many of these flights during the first frantic period of the pandemic, although they were not formally called off until less than 48 hours before the scheduled take-off time.These flights are included within the data set, but the disruption was unlikely to have affected as many people as more recent cancellations.Why are there still flights being cancelled with no COVID restrictions?The low overall percentages mean that you are still unlikely to have had your flight cancelled if you were set to travel this year, although it has been worse at different points, peaking in February when more than 1 in 20 flights from the UK was scrapped.One of the key reasons for the ongoing disruption is staffing.Kully Sandhu, managing director of Aviation Recruitment Network Ltd, said that the number of vacancies it is trying to fill for positions such as baggage handlers, cabin crew and cleaners had doubled since 2019, while the number of applicants had halved.Gatwick Airport told us its plans to manage the coming months were put in place because ""an airport review found that a number of companies based at Gatwick are operating with a severe lack of staff resources over the summer holiday period"".One of the things putting people off relates to the security requirements to work at airports. Applicants must provide a detailed five-year employment history, which is particularly rare for entry-level positions.Mr Sandhu said job adverts at certain airports are also more popular than others, depending on the demographics of the area.John Grant, chief analyst at OAG, said: ""When we entered COVID, airlines made a lot of people redundant. During that two-year furlough period, those people found jobs elsewhere and have not returned to the industry.""Of those that have returned, their security policies will have expired. They need to be vetted again and go through the same process as they did two years ago.""We didn't come out of lockdowns until the end of March as far as the air transport industry in Europe is concerned, so there's a huge amount of people who need to go through the process.""In the current strong jobs market, it is just easier and quicker to get other work - often with better hours - elsewhere, explained Mr Sandhu.He also said that Brexit had meant that workers from Europe, particularly those who only came to provide temporary labour in the busier seasons, were no longer applying in the same numbers.How does it compare with before the pandemic?The latest figures mean that a flight in 2022 is 2.5 times more likely to be cancelled than one booked during the same period in 2019, but there have been huge improvements compared with the peak of the pandemic.In April and May 2020, more than three-quarters of flights from the UK were cancelled and the number of scheduled flights has still not recovered to a ""normal"" level.How does the UK compare with other countries?The UK has performed worse than other major European countries that have had more than 200,000 flights scheduled this year so far.But the likes of the US, Canada, Indonesia and Turkey have performed even more badly. Mr Grant said that the US and Canada have only lifted COVID travel requirements in recent weeks, and pointed out that Indonesia was a very closed market as Asian countries applied their own rules to travel, ""creating almost total lockdowns"".The harsh lockdown means that of the biggest global airports, the worst-performing 20 are all from China.More than four in five flights from Shanghai's two airports were cancelled between April and May, the same proportion as have been cancelled in Ukraine since the Russian invasion.How can you avoid being affected?Mr Grant recommends booking away from the peak times and the busiest airports.He said: ""One of the interesting patterns is that if you choose to depart from 10am to 2pm, airports tend to be less congested. There's more space between planned departures and we're seeing lower rates of cancellation.""Certainly don't try to get on the first flight to your destination because that's when every airline in Europe is sending hundreds of aircraft in the sky, between 6am and 8am in the morning.""Another thing to consider is to fly from an airport that is smaller where there are fewer flights and fewer airlines operating, so there is more scope to accommodate those delays.""The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

11-07-2024,SkyNews,Travel,"Thinking of going to Barcelona? 'Better not,' tourists told","Water pistols squirted at tourists, tape crisscrossing the doors of hotels, placards brandished at lunching holidaymakers.The images from an anti-tourism protest in Barcelona were stark - but do they tell the whole story?About 3,000 people took part in the demonstration in the Catalan capital on Saturday, led by the Assemblea de Barris pel Decreixement Turistic (ABDT), which translates to Neighbourhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth.Why did they take to the streets - and should tourists reconsider their trips?'Tourists go home'The messages painted on cardboard placards were succinct: ""Tourists go home""; ""Tourists out""; ""Barcelona is not Disneyland"".So are tourists really not welcome in Barcelona?A spokesperson for ABDT told Sky News that, like the protests against overtourism in the Canary Islands, Saturday's demonstration was aimed at the tourism industry and authorities rather than individuals.But unlike Tenerife residents who were keen to distance themselves from the ""tourists go home"" rhetoric, Barcelona's protesters are happy for potential visitors to take their message on board.""If anyone asked us, 'should I come to Barcelona or better not?' our answer would be 'better not',"" the spokesperson said.""It hurts the city and its people and it's not even worth it for you,"" they added.They acknowledged it will take more than individual travellers changing their habits to alter the industry, but said they believed in everyone travelling ""less, closer and better"".""It would be great if some tourists stop coming, but that won't happen because of water guns, and won't happen in general by itself,"" they continued.They said people squirting water guns and blocking hotel entrances with tape were ""spontaneous actions"" during the protest, but added: ""The organisation does not condemn these actions, they are not even violent.""A manifesto for degrowthABDT's goal is ""tourism degrowth"" - both a reduction in tourist numbers and the city's economic dependence on the industry.They published a manifesto outlining the reasons for the protest, saying ""citizens suffer directly from the consequences"" of tourism.They say neighbourhoods have been gentrified and local identity lost, public services are under pressure, the cost of living and housing has gone up, and the planes, hire cars and cruise ships that carry tourists around damage the environment.""It's true that many people depend on [tourism], but most of that money stays in the hands of a few rich [people],"" the spokesperson told Sky News.Tourism sector jobs are renowned for being precarious, with ""awful work conditions and the worst wages in the city"", they said.Holiday rentals push out localsTourist numbers and housing costs have escalated in tandem, prompting calls for controls on the former to bring down the latter.In 2023, Spain welcomed a record-breaking 85 million international tourists.And Barcelona, home to 1.6 million people, saw almost 26 million overnight visitors in 2023, according to Barcelona City Council.With the rental market dominated by short-term tourist lets, housing has become unaffordable for many residents.Over the past decade, rents have risen 68% in the city, and the cost of buying a house by 38%, according to the property website Idealista.Even in the last year things have got worse, with rents in June up 18% on average compared to the previous year.Read more:Thousands march against mass tourism in Balearic IslandsThe popular destinations trying to limit tourism numbersCracking down on short-term rentalsOn 3 July, Spain's government announced a crackdown on short-term and seasonal holiday lettings.Listings on platforms such as Airbnb and Booking.com must have licences, and the government will ramp up its investigations to make sure they do.""If a house doesn't have a licence for tourism, advertising it on internet platforms should be illegal and thus punished,""consumer rights minister Pablo Bustinduy told state broadcaster TVE.Barcelona's mayor, Jaume Collboni, announced plans to ban renting homes to tourists, cancelling the licences of all 10,101 apartments currently approved as short-term rentals by November 2028.Spain's Constitutional Court is deliberating whether the move is legal.Apartur, the association of tourism apartment owners, said the measure amounted to expropriation (the taking by the state of private property, ostensibly for public good).ABDT, meanwhile, said the plan did not go far enough to tackle overtourism, noting it was announced alongside proposals to increase the number of hotel places.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsWhat do locals think?The majority of residents still feel tourism is beneficial rather than detrimental to the city, according to a report published by Barcelona City Council in 2023.But attitudes have shifted in recent years, the report shows, with increasing criticism of the industry and its impacts.""More and more people believe that Barcelona has reached its tourism capacity limit,"" the report says.""The economic contribution of tourism is recognised but this benefit does not tip the balance in its favour.""Half of respondents said they avoided areas popular with tourists, including the Old Town, the area surrounding the Sagrada Familia, and Park Guell.Targeting tourists is 'reprehensible uncivil behaviour'Rosario Sanchez, Spain's secretary of state for tourism, condemned the protests, telling Sky News the country remains one of the ""safest tourist destinations"".""Specific incidents with tourists are reprehensible uncivil behaviour that has nothing to do with the reality of our country,"" she said.She argued protesters were not ""not saying 'no to tourism',"" but wanted changes that addressed their quality of life.",https://news.sky.com/story/as-protesters-squirt-water-guns-at-tourists-are-brits-welcome-in-barcelona-13176003

More than half of those surveyed said they had experienced at least one problem with the carrier's customer services, with a fifth saying the company never replied to their email.One in 10 said they had experienced their call being disconnected after spending a long time in the queue.It comes after the company was recently ranked the worst airline for UK flight delays for the third year running, according to an analysis of Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) data.The second-worst airline for customer service, according to the Which? poll carried out in May, was Ryanair, which received a score of +28.British Airways (BA) was third from the bottom of the list with +46, although it did receive a slightly above-average score for how well issues and queries were resolved.The airlines hit back at the findings, with Wizz Air describing the report as ""inaccurate, unrepresentative and misleading"".Ryanair called it a ""fake survey"", while BA dismissed it as not ""representative or credible"".The top-performing airline, according to the poll, was Jet2, which received a customer satisfaction score of +81.Rocio Concha, a director at Which?, said: ""Travellers are currently facing some of the highest-ever fares, but our latest survey shows the standards of customer service of some airlines to be very poor.""Airlines must step up their game and ensure they are properly investing in their customer services to make it easier for passengers to get in touch with someone who can help, and get timely and effective solutions when they encounter a problem.""The government must prioritise giving the CAA stronger powers, including direct fining powers, so it can properly hold airlines to account when they fail to comply with consumer protection laws.""Read more business news:Boost to offshore wind capacity expectedVinted fashions $500m share saleMcDonald's sales fall worldwideBe the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for free'Not credible'Wizz Air UK's managing director Marion Geoffroy said: ""We do not accept the findings of this report, which are inaccurate, unrepresentative and misleading.""Which? only surveyed 68 Wizz Air customers, which is less than 0.001% of our UK customer base of 12.3 million passengers.""It is unclear to us how Which? can claim its survey is nationally representative when only 1.66% of their respondents said they had contacted Wizz Air's customer service team.""She added: ""We are serious about constantly improving and providing great customer service.

12-07-2024,SkyNews,Travel,M25 closure: Everything you need to know as works shut motorway between Junction 10 and 11 in Surrey,"A chunk of the M25 will once again be closed this weekend as part of  317m works on one of the UK's busiest and most dangerous motorway junctions.Engineers are constructing a new bridge near Junction 10 in Surrey in a bid to cut congestion and improve safety.This weekend's closure is the third so far this year, impacting a stretch through which up to 6,000 vehicles pass in each direction between 9am and 10pm on weekends.Holidaymakers are warned to plan ahead, while the Euros final, festivals and a potential upturn in the weather could result in more cars taking to the road than usual.Here's what you need to know about the latest closure.Where is the closure and what's the diversion?A 10-mile diversion will be set up to replace the route between Junctions 10 and 11, which will be shut from 9pm on Friday 12 July until 6am on Monday 15 July.From Junction 10 to 11 the route will be:Northbound on the A3 to Painshill Junction, A245 towards Woking and then the A320 to M25 Junction 11.From Junction 11 to 10 it looks like:South on the A320 towards Woking, A245 towards Byfleet and Painshill junction, then southbound on the A3 to Junction 10.How bad could it be?The first closure was in March, followed by another in May, which both went ""well"", according to National Highways senior project manager Jonathan Wade.This weekend's diversion matches the one set up in March, when traffic was not as bad as feared, despite some congestion stretching across two miles at one point.Amanda Boote, of Woking Borough Council, said at the time: ""It's actually been a lot better than we expected, it's not gridlocked in the way that we thought it would be.""But with England playing in the Euros final on Sunday, many may head to screenings in central London or watch at a friend's house.The closure could also disrupt journeys to Dover by England fans embarking on cross-Channel trips before driving to Berlin for the match.There's also the Goodwood Festival of Speed, Wireless and British Summer Time, while families may head to Thorpe Park.And with slightly improved conditions forecast, the AA's Chris Wood warns it's likely to be ""incredibly busy in and around London, particularly the M25 junctions 10 to 11"".""We advise drivers to plan their journey accordingly, avoiding the west side of the M25 if possible, but if not to expect delays and stick to the detour routes,"" he added.And there's one key bit of advice all drivers are urged to heed.Ignore your satnavsThe diversion sticks to A roads, but National Highways is concerned satnavs could direct drivers to minor roads after leaving the M25.This would cause congestion in residential areas.These fears were not realised during the first two closures, with motorists mostly sticking to the diverted route.""We would urge all drivers to follow the official diversion route as this is the best chance of reaching your destination in good time,"" Mr Wade said.""Please ignore your satnavs and follow our diversion route instead.""Airport warningsIt's especially important for holidaymakers to plan ahead if they're taking off from Heathrow or Gatwick, the country's two busiest airports.The RAC is advising people to travel ""earlier than usual"" if their journeys will be affected by the closure.RAC breakdown spokeswoman Alice Simpson said: ""We're asking holidaymakers to ensure they plan ahead, which means checking their route before they set off, leaving even earlier than usual and, importantly, making sure their vehicles are road ready by checking the oil, coolant and tyres to give themselves the best chance of avoiding a breakdown.""What's all this for?Shutting the motorway this weekend will enable the construction of a new bridge south of Junction 10.The project, which is due to be completed in summer 2025, will increase the number of lanes at Junction 10 by four.Will the diversion take me through a ULEZ zone?No, if motorists stick to the diverted route they will not go through any part of the ULEZ area.The last closure, in May, did take drivers through a section of the ULEZ, but nobody was penalised as long as they stuck to the official route.Read more:Drivers 'choosing to ignore' official diversion routeDrink driver took photo of speedometer before killing babyKeep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsWhen are the next closures?There will be two more weekends of closures, which will take place later this year.Those dates will be announced in due course, National Highways said.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for free",https://news.sky.com/story/m25-closure-everything-you-need-to-know-as-works-shut-motorway-between-junction-10-and-11-in-surrey-13176049

He advised that instead of offering an introductory discount, as the app encouraged, the best way to drum up business was to look up the price of local listings and then undercut them.

Their management platform is clunky, difficult to use and you can't vet people who book - they just instantly book and that's it, you're stuck with them. It's also a bit of a faff double-checking both platforms to make sure you aren't accidentally double booking. But it does generate significantly more bookings for us than Airbnb.As boring as it is, you also need to consider the tax implications.

Never before have we seen such an affectionate video of the couple, cuddling into each other and William kissing her cheek.If we were in any doubt about how much this has affected her physically and mentally, her message about returning to work makes it clear.While she will be working from home, there will only be a handful of public appearances for the rest of 2024.But remember even through this message she is using her platform to try to make a difference, to increase public understanding of what a cancer diagnosis can mean.Like the King, you get the sense she feels she owes it to all those who have written to her sharing their stories to continue to share her experiences, too.Her decision to tell us now isn't entirely unexpected.Read more:Kate's cancer update in fullKing marks second anniversary of late Queen's deathKate says it took time to explain diagnosis to her childrenHow the King has 'got his mojo back'Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeWith William and other members of the Royal Family returning to work last week, it was inevitable that questions would start to be asked about when we may see the princess.They will be desperate to avoid the speculation that raged about her health in the first half of the year, a dark time for all of them.That first video in March confirming her diagnosis was a brave move, but one that very quickly made the media trolls back off.By allowing a camera in now and briefly welcoming us into this side of their lives, she is showing us how precious family time is to them both.But she is also making a more subtle request - that they still need their privacy and want that to be respected as, in some ways, her recovery is only really beginning.",https://news.sky.com/story/kates-most-personal-video-yet-shows-never-before-seen-affection-and-what-really-matters-to-her-13212048

Some feel the  1.5bn saving will have a painful price.MP for York Central Rachel Maskell, who told Sky News she would abstain, said the swift timing of the vote, and lack of assessment of its impact, has left many concerned - not just those on the left sceptical about Sir Keir's leadership.A House of Lords committee which scrutinises secondary legislation said it had been introduced without proper evidence of its impact.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerA former member of the shadow cabinet, who will be reluctantly voting for the measure, told me he expected the chancellor to be forced to make changes in the run-up to the budget.In an interview this weekend, Sir Keir stood firm, saying there would be no change in course - as well as further difficult decisions coming down the track.He will head to Brighton in the morning in a big moment for an incoming Labour prime minister - addressing the Trades Union Congress (TUC) annual conference.He will be braced for criticism, with major union leaders including Sharon Graham, general secretary of Unite, and head of the TUC, Paul Novak, piling the pressure on and saying he should U-turn.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeSir Keir knows the cut will get through parliament and has shown he can be ruthless, having withdrawn the party whip from MPs who voted to axe the two-child benefit cap.But Labour MPs who back the measure through gritted teeth, and feel it's had too high a price, will be harder to win over next time.",https://news.sky.com/story/winter-fuel-cut-vote-will-test-sir-keir-starmers-authority-13212003
09-09-2024,SkyNews,Analysis,"Three key challenges for Kamala Harris: Biden's shadow, Trump's 'comrade' attacks and her interview problem ","Donald Trump and Kamala Harris face intense scrutiny in the remaining two months of the US election campaign.Ever since Ms Harris became the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee with Joe Biden's historic announcement he would not seek re-election, she has enjoyed a rapid ascent in polling.But momentum can swing quickly in an election campaign, and issues persist for both candidates - which could be crucial at their first debate on Tuesday.Read more:Your ultimate guide to the US electionThe challenges facing TrumpA recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College puts the former president one point ahead of the vice president, at 48% to 47% respectively.With only weeks to go until America goes to the polls, here's a look at three key challenges for the Democratic nominee...Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeRepublicans portray Kamala Harris as a California liberal of the hard left, a ""radical left lunatic"" as Donald Trump would have it.They point to her 'flip-flopping' on key policy areas and insist it exposes an extreme left agenda, while raising questions of authenticity and trust.In her effort to win the Democratic nomination in 2020, Harris took a left-leaning stance on several issues as she paid heed to her party's progressive wing. That has changed with her political elevation.As vice president, she duly aligned herself more centrally with the administration of the day and so modified her position on issues.On fracking - she favoured a ban, now doesn't; for healthcare, she backed a scheme to eliminate private insurance, now doesn't; on illegal border crossings, she supported decriminalisation, and now doesn't.In a recent interview, Harris addressed her shift by saying her values hadn't changed and her time as VP had given her a fresh perspective.Her opponents will insist she has chosen convenience over conviction in a cynical bid to hoodwink independent, moderate voters.There's a reason Joe Biden was struggling in the polls - his age didn't help, of course, but neither did his record.On a matter most important - the economy - he can cite improvement, having delivered on GDP, unemployment and inflation.His difficulty is in the economic indicators more measurable and meaningful to the public - prices at the petrol pumps and in the shops - that have left Americans feeling the pinch and feeling less well off than they were four years ago.Inflation may be falling, but prices are roughly 20% higher than they were during the COVID pandemic. As hard as the president has tried to sell ""Bidenomics,"" the voters aren't buying.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerIn her effort to escape the shadow of economic angst, Harris has unveiled proposals she says will cut costs and is punting a populist line that casts big business and greedy landlords as the villains making life difficult.Departing from Biden's big picture boasting about economic wins and legislative victories, she aims to talk money in terms the voter understands and to empathise with their concerns.The strategy needs to work for her. A CNBC survey in August found 40% of voters said they'd be better off financially under a Trump presidency compared to 21% if Harris won.Harris's opponents say that, as a core member of the existing government, she bears responsibility for the public's financial woes.They insist she will also have to answer for the record of the Biden administration as a whole - expect her to face awkward questions, too, on subjects like Afghanistan and the Israel/Hamas conflict.Read more:Will Starmer meet with Harris and Trump?Five things we learnt in Harris's DNC speechKeep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsKamala Harris can work a crowd.At the Democratic National Convention and at rallies across the country, she has demonstrated a stage presence and sure-footedness that energises the faithful. She's comfortable among friends.There remain questions about her vulnerability in more challenging surroundings and, in a country where politics is heavy on performance, that matters.A 2021 interview that Harris conducted with NBC's Lester Holt is given an occasional dusting off, which doesn't do her any favours.On being asked about her role in investigating the root causes of immigration, she was asked the seemingly straightforward question about visiting the US southern border and the exchange unfolded thus:Harris: ""We've been to the border.""Holt: ""You've not been to the border?""Harris: ""And I haven't been to Europe.""It's a brief exchange that took place three years ago and Kamala Harris has performed ably in numerous interviews since.However, that particular interview, and its awkwardness, springs to mind after a campaign - so far - of limited exposure.Since Joe Biden stepped down, Harris has only conducted one sit-down TV interview. Even then, it was with running mate Tim Walz by her side.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerThat's one set-piece - or joint - interview in six weeks.It would be an astonishing lack of independent scrutiny for someone bidding to be a local parish councillor, let alone president of the United States.There remain questions unasked of Kamala Harris and the apparent reluctance to address them creates a sense of vulnerability.The enthusiasm for a change in the ticket has shored up the Democratic vote, no doubt, but Harris needs to extend her reach to the undecideds, independents and Republicans feeling reluctant about Trump.They need to know who she is and what she stands for. Harris has come a distance in the polls but they are starting to look sticky.She needs the extra votes. If the TV interview is a risk, it's one she might have to take - more than once every six weeks.It's one thing rolling out the teleprompted hits to the adoring masses, it's quite another sitting down for independent interrogation.That, perhaps more than elsewhere, is where judgement lies.",https://news.sky.com/story/three-key-challenges-for-kamala-harris-bidens-shadow-trumps-comrade-attacks-and-her-interview-problem-13211760
08-09-2024,SkyNews,Analysis,Green Party's Gaza stance won over Muslim voters - now they hope their progressive policies will keep them,"The Green Party had a very good general election and they know it.Alongside their hemp tote bags and multi-use water bottles this weekend, there was a palpable sense of renewed enthusiasm at their annual conference.They were not shy about where some of their two million votes came from. Soaring numbers of British Muslims voted Green this election and helped the party secure four new MPs. And this weekend felt as if they wanted to build on that support.It was no secret, even before the election, that some British Muslims had begun to lose trust in Labour over its early stance on the Israel-Gaza war.This anti-Labour sentiment was galvanised through efficient organising by campaign groups like ""The Muslim Vote"" which had begun a campaign to try to funnel votes away from the major parties and towards the candidates they believed better served the Muslim community.While there is a wide diversity of Muslim voters, and huge complexities in how different communities vote, the biggest uniting factor that focused minds around voting was undoubtedly the community's dismay at Israel's bombing of Gaza.Looking on from afar were the Greens. The Greens were all too happy to fill Labour's space.Sky polling just ahead of the election discovered a slight ""Gaza effect"", which showed leader satisfaction levels for the Conservatives and Labour significantly dropping after 7 October amongst ethnic minority voters, with IPSOS suggesting they were moving towards smaller parties.If anywhere showed that most visibly on election night, it was Bristol Central where the Greens won its biggest scalp of the night.Thangam Debbonaire, a big beast in the Labour Party and the shadow culture secretary, lost her seat of Bristol Central - where there is a significant Somali community - to the Greens co-leader Carla Denyer.Sir Keir Starmer even visited the constituency throughout the election, in perhaps a sign that the party knew her campaign needed heavyweight support.Where the Greens came a strong second and third place in constituencies around places like Sheffield Central and in east London, data showed they were in areas with large Muslim populations.Read more:Starmer 'determined to make tough decisions'Sign ups for pension credit doubleThis weekend, the Greens chose their one media visit outside the conference to visit a mosque in the Tory town of Altrincham to highlight community engagement. The focus? Gaza.In his speech, Zach Polanski, the Greens deputy leader, called the situation in Gaza a ""genocide"" - something Israel has repeatedly denied - and pushed Labour to stop arms sales completely to Israel, instead of just the 30 out of 350 arms export licences they suspended earlier this week.I asked the Green's co-leader Adrian Ramsay whether this was part of a strategic play for more votes.""I particularly wanted to make sure I was visiting the mosque, engaging with the Muslim community because we have to remember how much our Muslim communities around the country have felt targeted, felt vulnerable by the horrific events and disorder from political violence during the summer,"" he said.""We do need to stand together, and we also need to stand together with our Jewish and Muslim communities who feel vulnerable because of what's happening in the Middle East""Fesl Reza-Khan, a new party member who signed up in November because of the party's stance on Gaza, co-created a Muslim Greens group to organise activists across the UK.""A lot of us are from ethnic minority backgrounds.

Nor will we have the hearing on whether the conviction is affected by a recent Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity for official acts.Read more:Putin reveals who he says he wants to win US electionCheney: Trump can 'never be trusted with power again'The judge in the New York case will also decide on that following the election.It leaves open the possibility that Trump will have his wish to have the guilty verdict tossed out. It would be big news, if and when it happens.For now, he hopes it casts a big enough doubt over the process to minimise its impact at the ballot box.Abortion and reproductive rightsAbortion is one of the big issues in this election, no question. The question is where Mr Trump stands on the matter.His position has been that abortion rights should be a matter for US states to decide but, within the past couple of weeks, he has sown confusion over his stance.In an interview, he said Florida's ban after six weeks of pregnancy was too strict but then appeared to contradict himself when he said he would vote 'no' to changing it.He also said that, if elected, his government would cover the cost of in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) - this, after he has boasted about enabling the end of Roe v Wade, the Supreme Court decision that has cast doubt over IVF access.His opponents insist he would say anything on abortion to get elected and the Harris campaign calls him a fundamental threat to reproductive freedom and to women's healthcare generally.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsIt is an issue that has strong traction with voters and was instrumental in Democratic success at the 2022 primaries.Trump is treading a line between pro-life and pro-choice and is troubled by the differing demands of key demographics.The issue of reproductive rights is important to the evangelicals who helped propel him to power but it also resonates strongly with the wider female vote.

That's if they saw it.The inquiry heard how the project's main fire safety consultant didn't even visit Grenfell once refurbishment was complete.Then there were the regulations themselves and the successive governments responsible for them. They were ambiguous, chronically out of date, and fatally flawed in not explicitly banning flammable materials from high-rise buildings despite warnings, near-misses, and even deadly fires elsewhere.Of course, these links overlap and interconnect.If fire testing or regulations hadn't been a joke, flammable cladding wouldn't have been allowed on a 24-storey building. If the architect, contractor, or council had known or asked more about fire safety, the problem could have been spotted.And after the loss of life, that's perhaps the most tragic thing about the Grenfell disaster; the number of missed opportunities for perhaps just one person to do their job properly and break the chain of failure.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerAlmost no one admitted their faultAt the inquiry - probably on the advice of lawyers - hardly any organisation or individual admitted fault for their part in the disaster.It should have been where an entire industry hung its heads in collective shame.It was not within Sir Martin's remit to find criminal responsibility. However, the inquiry identifies much that could meet that definition.Now its report is done the Metropolitan Police investigation can resume.For the sake of the victims, but also for anyone with a roof over their heads, it should do so swiftly so those responsible face justice.On top of the report's 58 recommendations, prosecutions would send the strongest message to the construction industry and its regulators that a disaster like Grenfell can't be allowed to happen again.The UK Tonight With Sarah-Jane Mee will have a special programme on the Grenfell Tower report at 8pm on Sky News",https://news.sky.com/story/grenfell-tower-fire-was-the-final-fatal-link-in-a-chain-of-unimaginable-human-failure-13209274

He is also being investigated for allegedly refusing to share information and documents with investigators.Representatives for Telegram have said the company abides by EU laws and its moderation is in line with industry standards.The company added in a statement: ""It is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner is responsible for abuse of that platform.""Read moreWho is the Telegram founder?Durov's arrest works to Russia's advantageZuckerberg claimed White House 'pressured' MetaBe the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeDurov's arrest had other tech bosses up in arms.

The new forever war being waged in their name shows no end in sight and it is time for a reckoning.Middle East latest: General strike called in Israel as pressure grows on NetanyahuThere is a consensus forming among Israel's commentators and opinion formers across the political spectrum that the obstacle to a deal bringing home the hostages is the prime minister.It is no longer just those observers on the left blaming him. The ceasefire deal being pushed by the US is on life support because Mr Netanyahu shifted his position at the 11th hour of negotiations and made new demands.His own senior negotiators were so frustrated by his vacillation they leaked evidence of it to the press.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsHamas have played fast and loose too, not least sending a suicide bomber to Tel Aviv at the height of negotiations.But diplomats close to the negotiations say there is little doubt that were it not for Mr Netanyahu's tactics an agreement would have been made and the hostages, or many of them, would be coming home.Read more:Satellite evidence suggests Israel is building long-term presence in GazaHamas commander killed in West Bank, Israeli military saysPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerA reckoning is of course coming. It is just a question of time. And Mr Netanyahu knows that any ceasefire deal brings that moment closer.What follows could lay bare his failures as leader before 7 October and since.A sense of that came from Yair Lapid, the Israeli opposition leader, who last week claimed there were ""repeated strategic warnings of an eruption of violence and the loss of deterrence"" before 7 October.There is also a sense of failure and loss of confidence among Israelis, which is profoundly shocking to outsiders who know them well.As one veteran Israeli observer put it to me recently, whatever their crises, Israelis have always believed in the end they would bounce back and prevail. But now they are not sure. That is a fundamental break with the past and it is deeply unnerving.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeIt is essential for the national psyche for Israelis to move on. But they will only recover their chutzpah when they establish what went wrong.Central to that process will be the way they handle the leader at the centre of it all, Mr Netanyahu.The prime minister has pressing political reasons not to sign a ceasefire deal. It could torpedo his government. His far-right extremist coalition partners might walk.But those who know the prime minister say there's more than that at play. He is worried about his legacy and clings to the hope he can still claw victory from the quagmire in Gaza.He sees himself as an Israeli Churchill and anything short of the total victory he promised is not acceptable, however deluded that seems.Six months ago Joe Biden warned that Mr Netanyahu was ""hurting Israel"" more than helping it.More and more Israelis believe their prime minister is delaying the inevitable for no reason but his own political survival and that selfishness is now costing lives.That cannot go on indefinitely.

01-09-2024,SkyNews,Analysis,Chancellor makes 'mistake' with Winter Fuel Payment - but she has chance to make corrections,"Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey calls it ""the first big mistake this government has made"".The decision by the new Labour Chancellor Rachel Reeves to axe the  300 Winter Fuel Payment for 10 million pensioners forever is probably the biggest domestic headache for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer as MPs return to Westminster from their summer holidays this week.It may soon lead to the first big climbdown by the incoming government.Follow latest politics updatesIn the first few weeks after winning July's general election, Labour has used its honeymoon to blame the last Conservative government for the poor state of the nation and the dim prospects for recovery.Ministers exposed two ""black holes"" - the first is the gap between planned annual expenditure and expected income and borrowing. A subject widely discussed by everyone except the leading politicians during the recent election campaign.More dramatically, on 29 July Reeves accused the Conservatives of hiding a further  22bn shortfall in the current year's finances.Four Ws dominated the TUC - expect another showdown at Labour conferenceGovernment will not 'water down' winter fuel payment cut to 10 million pensioners, minister saysWinter fuel backlash and union heat shows Starmer's honeymoon is well and truly overHer response was to make ""incredibly tough choices"", including limiting what had been a flat payment to all pensioners to only those on pensioner credit or other benefits.This equates to just over a million of the total of more than 11 million who have been receiving the payments - those with incomes of  12,600 a year or less, a ""very, very low"" figure in the words of Martin Lewis, the personal finance expert.At the same time as the cutbacks for the elderly, the chancellor announced she had found the cash to fully fund the above-inflation pay awards for the public sector and to buy off strikes by rail and doctors' unions.These payouts account for around half of the short-term black hole Reeves claimed she had been left by the Tories, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.Reeves 'caved meekly'Impetuosity and inexperience lie behind the troublesome winter fuel announcement - for which no properly argued explanation, beyond regret, was offered.Reeves appeared to have caved meekly to the Treasury's traditional bean-counting smallness, which often looks better on the spreadsheet than in the real world.For a start, if implemented as the government says it intends, it would not even save the relatively paltry  1.5bn intended.Currently, 866,000 poor people, some 30% of those eligible, do not take up pension credit. The government says it plans a drive to encourage applications.Were they all to be successful the Exchequer would be out of pocket, spending more not saving.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerChancellor's easy pickingsA philosophical undertow in Starmer's Labour also helps explain why pensioners were the first call for his chancellor's easy pickings. Starmer does not declare ""we are all in it together""; his concerns are more focused on ""working people"".Most pensioners, especially the oldest, do not work. Starmer says he prefers to spend the money on making the trains run and shorter NHS waiting lists - mainly to benefit the workforce who he is relying on to deliver growth.There is also a perception that it is time to level out (""up"" is not the right word in this context) because pensioners have done better than younger cohorts in recent decades.The last Labour government made ending pensioner poverty a priority and successive governments have kept the triple lock in place for state pension increases.As a result, the former Conservative cabinet minister David Willetts, who now heads the Resolution Foundation, reports that pensioner incomes have doubled while incomes for the rest have only gone up by half in the same time period.The difficulty for Labour is that comparisons between the generations are only relative. And relative pensioner poverty has actually gone up from 13% in 2011-2012 to 16% in 2022-23.Reeves has created a painful cliff edge by limiting winter fuel payments to those on an income of  230 a week.Pensioners not where Labour gets votesThere are millions of pensioners just above that red line who are also struggling to get by. This winter that will be even harder because the energy regulator Ofgem has approved a 10% rise in the energy price cap, on average that means a  500 annual increase in bills.Pensioners are not where Labour gets its votes. The party's constituency is ""working people"".The Conservatives focused heavily and unsuccessfully on older voters in this year's general election. As it turned out, a voter had to be aged 62 or over to be more likely to vote Conservative than Labour.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerNobody is Malthusian enough to say that it would be a good thing if pensioners die of cold, but the fact remains that the growing percentage of the population which is elderly is a major economic problem in developed countries, including Britain.Until now, winter fuel payments (worth  300 to the over-80s and  200 to younger pensioners) were paid out automatically to all pensioners regardless of wealth.Some poorer pensioners have also been eligible for a cost of living payment worth up to  300 and a one-off warm home discount of  150.These payments should not be confused with the discretionary means-tested cold weather payments made by councils in the event of a sustained period of freezing temperatures.Read more:243-question form to get winter paymentAre you still eligible for the payment?Analysis: Reeves under attack on two frontsKeep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsBadly designed schemeStarmer complained at his news conference last week that winter fuel payments are ""not particularly well designed"". By which he meant that wealthier pensioners who do not need the money were getting it.That is true, although it could be regarded as a tax allowance. Reeves has rushed into introducing another badly designed scheme which will have millions of victims.Her speech had relatively little impact when she delivered it at the start of the summer holidays on 29 July. Now the news has sunk in, 450,000 people have signed an Age Concern petition against the plan.Conservative MPs have tabled an early day motion against it, which could force the government to hold a vote. Meanwhile, mainstream loyalist MPs are expressing their concern in private.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerSlump in government's popularityThe generations are not taking sides against each other. Young people face much greater costs for higher education and are struggling to buy their own homes.But, on average, there are also significant transfers of money down the generations as parents and grandparents do what they can to help out.The government's popularity has slumped in opinion polls. Only 23% approved of the government, compared to 51% who disapproved in YouGov's survey last week. The fuel payment cut is opposed by all age groups.Conservative politician Gavin Barwell gloated: ""This is what happens if you aren't straight with the people before polling day - and yes, the Conservatives weren't either - and say you have to cut fuel payments for all but the poorest pensioners because there's no money while offering public sector workers more generous pay deals.""As her critics are pointing out, Reeves could have avoided controversy, and made the new system fairer, if she had simply said that from now on the payments would be taxable, as pensions already are. But she chose not to.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for free  Tap here to follow the Sky News Daily podcast  Instead, she made a similar mistake to former Labour chancellor Gordon Brown, who, by the way, introduced the Winter Fuel Payment. Brown abolished the 10p rate in his last budget and failed to take account of the income cliff edges he was creating for lower earners.His admitted ""mistake"" caused an outcry. It dogged Brown's subsequent term as prime minister, while his chancellor Alistair Darling tried repeatedly to make up for it. And that was in a budget when Brown cut the basic rate of income tax. Reeves has no such plans.The chancellor has a chance to make corrections. She could try and raise the cut-off threshold now.It would be wiser to take a breath and to say now that she plans to give her plans further consideration in her budget, which is already scheduled on 30 October.That would allow her to think again about her hasty and callous measure in the proper, broader, context of the economic situation in which citizens of all ages find themselves.",https://news.sky.com/story/chancellor-makes-mistake-with-winter-fuel-payment-but-she-has-chance-to-make-corrections-13205994
29-08-2024,SkyNews,Analysis,Challenge for Starmer to turn warm words with EU into economic wins for UK ,"Parliament is yet to return, but Sir Keir Starmer has used the last few days of August to frame the next few months of his premiership.First, there was the bad news - his warning from the Downing Street garden that things are going to get a lot worse before they get better, with ""painful"" decisions in the shape of tax rises and spending cuts on the way this autumn.Second, was his attempt to inject some hope into his project and make good on that election message of change - with a visit to Berlin to talk up a ""once in a generational chance"" to ""turn the corner on Brexit"".Politics live: New treaty 'very scant on detail'The vehicle for a speech of optimism in the gloom came in the shape of a bilateral treaty between the UK and Germany, who are negotiating to deepen security, defence and trade ties.It would be the first of its kind between the UK and its biggest trading partner in Europe, and watching the rapport between Chancellor Schloz and the prime minister, it was clear that there was much goodwill and common ground between these two leaders.As the German premier said at their joint press conference in Berlin: ""I am happy about the announcement by Keir Starmer to seek a reset in the relations to the European Union. We want to take this hand which is reached out to us.""Starmer wants reset with EU - 'but that does not mean reversing Brexit'Adam Boulton: Bank holiday travellers beware - getting to and from Europe is about to get a whole lot harderSir Keir Starmer says work is under way for closer ties with EU and to fix UK's 'botched' Brexit dealKeep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsBoth sides want to wrap up the deal by the end of the year, with whispers Sir Keir will be back in the German capital sooner rather than later to sign off on the treaty.It will be seen and sold as a political win and a reset in Anglo-German relations, undoubtedly strained by Brexit.The two leaders spoke about a new framework they were working on to better co-ordinate on illegal migration - Sir Keir has long talked about the supply of small boats coming through Germany.They also spoke of deepening trade and security ties, as well as cultural and societal ones.There was a nod to collaboration on energy and supply chains - Sir Keir visited a Siemens energy factory after the news conference, while Number 10 said it wanted an ""ambitious agreement"" to ""deepen market access"".Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerBut there is an obvious elephant in the room. On the one hand, Sir Keir really wants to fulfil his number one mission for government - to become the fastest growing economy in the G7 and take this once-in-a-generation chance to reset relations with European partners.On the other, this is a prime minister who is insistent there will be no unravelling of Brexit, having ruled out re-entering the European Union, single market or customs union in his lifetime.It is obvious Germany, France, or any country that is part of the single market, cannot access bilateral trade deals - that is the point of being in the EU trading bloc. So is this just all a lot of warm words and hot air?Because meaningful improvements in any trade deal will involve concessions. One big ask from Germany - in effect repeated by Chancellor Schloz at the press conferences - is for a youth mobility scheme between the UK and other European countries.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeWhen I asked Sir Keir about this at the press conference, he explicitly ruled it out, telling me: ""We do not have plans for the youth mobility scheme, but we do have plans for a closer relationship between us and the EU.""He later told reporters he did not rule out setting up some sort of system for other link-ups, for example, student exchanges. Freedom of movement is still a red line, but time-limited exchanges are perhaps not.This matters because it gets to the meat of what a closer relationship looks like. If the prime minister wants to change warm words into real action, there will need to be concessions, and on Wednesday Chancellor Schloz was clearly laying out one such possible deal.There are, UK officials tell me, things the two countries can do, such as easing UK access to German markets by, for example, creating beneficial arrangements so regulatory barriers are removed and British companies are able to be part of tender processes.But this is tinkering at the edges rather than real reform.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerThere are plenty back home who will argue that if Sir Keir really wants a reset he should look again at Brexit, because this would be a tangible way of removing trade barriers and going for the economic growth that underpins his entire project. But on this, the prime minister says he will not budge.By the end of the year, we will have a far better sense of what Sir Keir can achieve with a change of tone, if not substance, in the shape of the first bilateral treaty between Germany and the UK.But at the moment, it's hard to see how he turns those warm words into real wins for the UK economy.",https://news.sky.com/story/challenge-for-starmer-to-turn-warm-words-with-eu-into-economic-wins-for-uk-13204922

Such is the draw of Donald Trump in places like this.I'm back in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, a town I've been to a few times over the past eight years.I was first here in 2016, on the night when Donald Trump dramatically defeated Hillary Clinton - the election which propelled him to the White House. I returned four years later when Trump lost to Joe Biden.This is a rust belt town which feels now to be rusting away.It's one of those neglected places in America, a town bypassed by highways and forgotten by people who live a better life somewhere else.The thriving steel industry on which Johnstown was built is long gone. The vast metal plant which once dominated the town centre now employs just a fraction of the workers.

And today, there is a buzz in the air because their man is passing through.With 10 weeks to go until the most pivotal of elections, Donald Trump and his opponent, Kamala Harris, are criss-crossing the country, shuttling between the few swing states where the future of this country will be decided.In Pennsylvania and just a few other states, the margins are so tight, it could swing either way.And so, just as he did in 2016 and 2020, Donald Trump came to Johnstown to tell the people here, again, that he will make their lives better.""We're going to win back the White House."" he told the cheering crowd in a packed arena.""We're going to make this country greater than it's ever been... We're going to bring in tremendous numbers of factories.""Together, we will deliver low taxes, low regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates, low inflation, so that everyone can afford groceries, a car and a home.""He hit every button and here, among the faithful who attend these rallies, they believe his pledges.But here's the thing. Despite his promises, he never got the factories outside this arena re-opened when he was last president.A combination of factors is fuelling Trump's enduring appeal.Part of it is explained by deep-set conservative Christian values which Trumpian Republicanism has latched on to so well - the yearning for 'the good old days'.Part of it is the soaring inflation over the past few years - the sharp post-pandemic increase in global commodity prices, compounded by Ukraine war-related supply chain and energy delivery disruption. Here, in this rally, among Mr Trump's supporters, Joe Biden foots the blame for all that. He's been the president. No debate.But it's also viscerally clear that part of America feels marginalised and ignored as 'progressive' liberals progress with policies and lifestyles that people in places like Johnstown feel are not aligned with them or helping them.Put simply, the lives of the people in this arena felt better back under the first Trump term, despite the unfulfilled promises, because they have felt even worse through the past four years under Joe Biden.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerDonald Trump, the salesman, has harnessed this anger with pitch-perfect rhetoric.

It was an admission that led to accusations that there was nothing like the zeal of a reformed smoker.Read more:How would an outdoor smoking ban work?The current Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has been spotted smoking a crafty cigarette on occasions.

Labour votes meant a 383-67 vote in favour.Of the six current Tory leadership candidates, Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick voted against, Tom Tugendhat, James Cleverly and Mel Stride voted in favour, and Priti Patel did not vote.Before it comes to a Commons vote on an outdoor ban, however, there's a whole packet of burning issues to be considered.What about smoking on the pavement outside a pub or restaurant? Or outside hospitals, schools, college and university campuses, sports grounds, gyms or other sporting venues?Plenty of MPs will have a view on all those questions. But one of Westminster's newest MPs, the beer 'n' baccy loving member for Clacton, has a simple message for the PM: butt out!""I'll never go the pub again if outdoor smoking is banned,"" Reform UK leader Nigel Farage wrote for The Telegraph website. Drastic!So far, however, public opinion appears to be against Mr Farage on outlawing lighting up outdoors.

But already she's facing a political onslaught on two fronts.Tories claim the fiscal event will be a Halloween horror for the middle classes and ""Middle England"", with rumoured rises in inheritance tax and capital gains tax.And the chancellor also faces a backbench backlash from Labour MPs over her axing of winter fuel payments of up to  300 for all but the most hard-up pensioners.Politics live: 'Very scant detail' on UK-Germany treatyBut the woman who sees herself as an ""iron chancellor"" shows no sign of bowing to pressure from her critics on either controversy. Yet.The day after Sir Keir Starmer's warning that the budget would be ""painful"" - ""I never promised you a rose garden,"" said one headline - she refused three times to rule out the expected tax rises.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsIn a tetchy interview during a visit to Scotland, the exchange went like this:New Shetland wind farm could power 500,000 homesCustomers owe billions to energy firms ahead of tough winter, leading industry figure warnsPensioner, 90, says he will have to shower once a week as government withdraws fuel payment and energy bills go up""Can you rule out raising inheritance tax and raising capital gains in the budget?""""I'm not going to write a budget two months ahead of delivering it.""""Can you rule it out?""""We're going to have to make a series of difficult decisions...""""So you can't rule it out?""""I'll set out the budget on 30 October.""

Since then, seven successive Tory chancellors, from George Osborne to Jeremy Hunt, kept it, even in the Conservatives' austerity years.But Ms Reeves would do well to heed the lessons from Mr Brown's own blunder in 1999 when he increased the state pension by a derisory 75p and was forced into a humiliating U-turn.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerAfter Sir Keir's ""short-term pain for long-term-good"" appeal this week, Labour's chief cheerleader in Fleet Street, the Daily Mirror, declared in its leader column: ""It's time for a fuel U-turn.""Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire revealed the paper's postbag was ""bulging"" and wrote: ""This is a moment for Starmer and Reeves to heed Denis Healey's first law of politics, which was for those in a hole to stop digging.""So what's the lesson, then, for the chancellor and prime minister from the twin assault she's facing, on tax and fuel bills?It's surely that the evidence from polls and postbags is the public will put up with some tax rises for the better off in so-called ""Middle England"".But tales of freezing pensioners this Christmas won't go down well with voters.

28-08-2024,SkyNews,Analysis,Sir Keir Starmer will need to show progress on his missions amid the bleak picture he has painted,"Cast your mind back to the heady days of early July, as a beaming Sir Keir Starmer swept into Downing Street to a cheering crowd and the promise of ""change"".Britain's seventh ever Labour prime minister had won a landslide that deservedly drew parallels between himself and the party's most successful election winner Tony Blair.Yet on Tuesday, just over 50 days on from that moment, Sir Keir was very clear that the ballot box victory was where the parallel ends.Politics live: Starmer offers biggest clue yet as to where possible tax rises may hitForget New Labour's ""things can only get better"" mantra. In his first major Downing Street speech, this prime minister was clear that in his Britain ""things can only get worse - for now"".Armed with a new slogan across the lectern - ""fixing the foundations"" - Sir Keir set out the parlous state of the public finances, the dangerous populism that had flourished under the Tories and corroded our communities, triggering the recent riots, and the erosion of trust between government and the governed.He reiterated his commitment to put government ""back into the service of working people"" and to repair ""broken Britain"". But, he said, it would take time, be ""painful"" and involve unpopular decisions.Winter fuel backlash and union heat shows Starmer's honeymoon is well and truly overWinter fuel cut vote will test Sir Keir Starmer's authorityMPs to vote on cutting winter fuel payment for pensioners as Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds says government has 'no choice'Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsIn a nutshell, this was a prime minister preparing the ground for tax rises and spending cuts in the autumn - all those questions avoided during the general election, now answered up front from the vantage point of being in government with a massive majority.The autumn budget was ""going to be painful"", he told an audience of members of the public he had met during the election campaign.""We have no other choice, given the situation we're in,"" he added. ""Frankly, things will get worse before they get better.""Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerFor all the talk of doing politics differently, Sir Keir was rolling out a well-worn political strategy - blame the previous government for the terrible state of the country in order to create some space to do unpopular things.His calculation is that the public will blame the past government, not his, particularly if - as he highlighted in his speech - voters can see the new administration is getting on with its priorities around growing the economy, green energy, housebuilding, or cutting NHS waiting lists by striking public sector pay deals.""Come the autumn, if we can show we are getting on with it, we hope it will buy us some time,"" said one senior government figure. ""What people will want is progress checks.""But, as the controversy over the scrapping of the universal winter fuel allowance payments to pensioners shows, these difficult decisions will face a backlash.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeThe Starmer administration is already under fire from some on its own side to amend the policy and that noise is unlikely to dim as the increased energy price cap kicks in over the autumn and winter.And what of tax rises? Sir Keir told me in our Sky News Leaders' Debate he had ""no plans"" to raise taxes beyond what was outlined in the manifesto.Now he says that what Labour characterise as a  22bn ""black hole"" in the public finances - caused in part by Labour's decision to settle on public sector pay recommendations - leave him with few options.But in reality, questions around tax rises and spending cuts, given the state of the public finances, were raised repeatedly in the election, and Labour avoided answering them.Rishi Sunak is now already arguing that Labour are doing what he warned they would in the election - put up taxes.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerThis will undoubtedly be the running battle of the autumn. On Tuesday, Sir Keir ruled out raising taxes on ""working people"", in the shape of income tax, national insurance of VAT.But he left no doubt in my mind tax rises were on the way as he signalled that ""those with the broadest shoulders"" should carry the burden, paving the way for more levies on the wealthy, and perhaps big business too.Sir Keir might be successful politically in pinning the blame on the Tories. But he does not want to just have a political win. He wants to restore trust in politics.For now, voters might be forgiven for thinking it is more of the same - the promise of change before the election only to then witness a blame game in which politicians trade blows and the public have to take the political pain after the win.Things can only get worse is indeed, as Sharon Graham of Unite put it after Sir Keir's speech, a ""bleak picture"" of Britain. But it is now the opening chapter of this Labour administration.For a country running out of patience, Sir Keir will need to show some progress on his missions too.

26-08-2024,SkyNews,Analysis,"Pavel Durov's arrest, much like the Telegram app, works to Russia's advantage","Is Pavel Durov a brave crusader for liberty and free-speech, or a compromised individual whose social media platform empowers criminals, paedophiles and even Vladmir Putin?The French authorities certainly think he has questions to answer.Social media bosses are regularly questioned by governments - like the recent grilling of the heads of TikTok, Meta, and X before US Congress.But French prosecutors have taken the virtually unprecedented step of arresting a tech boss over what they say is criminal activity on Durov's platform Telegram and his refusal to cooperate in their investigations.Telegram has rejected any such accusation saying it abides with all EU laws and that Durov has ""nothing to hide"".But Durov's arrest is a consequential one.It fits the narrative being pushed hard by libertarian loud-mouths with massive social media followings like Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson that efforts by western governments to regulate online platforms are political overreach and a direct attack on free speech.AI technology can detect early signs of over 1,000 diseases, say researchersTiny knee bone linked to arthritis may have helped humans walk upright, scientists suggestDengue fever: Popular European holiday hotspots at risk of being hit by tropical disease, warn UK scientistsEfforts to regulate encrypted platforms like Telegram, widely known to be used by organised gangs, paedophiles, money launderers and cybercriminals are, they argue, an effort to censor freedom of expression and the growth of cryptocurrencies that threaten vested political interests.But where does Pavel Durov stand in all of this?He founded his first social media company Vkontakte in his early 20s. His platform, a Russian language rival to Facebook, rapidly led to run-ins with Vladimir Putin's government.The authorities demanded to block access to political opponents using the site or have access to their data - Durov boldly and publicly refused - making him a hero to Russian the opposition.At one rally protesting Russia's early threats to block Telegram, Durov was portrayed as an icon with the Telegram logo held in his saintly fingers.Read more:Who is Pavel Durov?Macron says Durov's arrest was not politicalRussian official criticises Durov's arrestHis departure from Russia, founding of Telegram and later acquiring French citizenship - including a name change to Paul du Rove - paint a picture of a man committed to upholding free speech in the face of oppressive regimes.""Russia's Mark Zuckerberg"" certainly fits the contemporary profile of a tech billionaire. That's to say to some he's a role-model of success and self-discipline to others, a self-aggrandising egomaniac.His social media posts feature him posing in black, or sometimes shirtless, among the natural beauty of places he visits. He's a self-proclaimed ascetic who consumes no meat or alcohol, values ice baths and shuns relationships.He also seems to share the modern tech mogul's obsession with fecundity - posting last month how, through sperm donation, he is now the father of more than 100 children in 12 countries.But there's speculation too that France's interest in him may also be linked to his platform's ties to another man with a penchant for shirtless photoshoots.Vladmir Putin took steps to shut down Telegram when it first appeared in Russia. The encrypted messaging, trading and networking app was being readily exploited by his opponents as well as criminals.But in 2018 the Kremlin suddenly ended its pursuit of Telegram, where it is now one of Russia's most popular social media apps - even with the Russian military. A leading Russian pro-war blogger joked after Durov's arrest: ""De-facto they detained the head of communications for the Russian Army"".A rival encrypted messaging app Signal, whose servers, unlike many of Telegram's are not hosted in Russia, was recently banned there.Telegram has previously said that ""no deals"" were made with Russia in order for Telegram to continue operating there and Durov has long maintained that both he and his platform are staunchly apolitical.Sensitive to accusations of political motivations, French President Emanuel Macron said today Durov's arrest was part of a judicial investigation and that France was committed to freedom of expression and entrepreneurship.But just as the Telegram app currently works to Russia's advantage so too does Durov's arrest.We now have the irony of the Russian government, with a long history of controlling social media and detaining political opponents, calling Durov's arrest politically driven and an attack on free speech.",https://news.sky.com/story/pavel-durovs-arrest-much-like-the-telegram-app-works-to-russias-advantage-13203881

22-08-2024,SkyNews,Analysis,Lecanemab: Bittersweet moment for Alzheimer's patients - but hope of treatment is still possible,"This is a bittersweet moment for people living with Alzheimer's disease and their families.Hopes had been high that for the first time they would have access to a treatment that could slow the decline in memory and thinking.When a pivotal clinical trial was released last year doctors hailed lecanemab as a game-changer, one that could delay the need for care and give families more time together.But while the medicine's regulator has agreed that the drug can be prescribed, the NHS spending watchdog has ruled in draft guidance that it is too expensive to justify the benefits.Unusually that isn't just because of the cost of the drug.It's also the resource implications for the NHS of organising fortnightly infusions for so many people. And then there is the careful diagnosis and intensive monitoring that is needed to keep patients safe.Lecanemab is a potent drug. It clears the clumps of abnormal protein called amyloid that build up in the brains of people with Alzheimer's.But in doing so it can sometimes cause dangerous swelling and bleeding in the brain.So doctors need to be sure patients really have Alzheimer's before they start treatment.That can only be done at the moment with expensive PET brain scans or samples of spinal fluid - and the NHS doesn't have enough of the right machines or staff.And patients also need regular checks with an MRI scanner to check there are no side effects in the brain.All in all, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said it wasn't worth all the resources just to delay the slide from mild to moderate disease by about four to six months.Read more:New AI tool could be game-changer in battle against Alzheimer'sFive patients developed Alzheimer's from treatment, doctors findThe decision applies to England - Wales and Northern Ireland often follow that lead.

22-08-2024,SkyNews,Analysis,"Despite Home Office claims, small boat crossings haven't fallen - but look elsewhere for real immigration story","Let's start with one claim that's been causing a bit of confusion today.Contrary to what the Home Office press release today suggests, small boat crossings to the UK have not fallen since last year - at least not in any sense that any normal person would understand it.Actually, the cumulative number of people coming across the Channel to the UK this year is running at a higher rate than this time last year - about 18% higher as of the end of June and about 11% higher as of last week.So how, you might be wondering, can the Home Office possibly claim that small boats are down 29% on last year? The short answer is that what they're talking about is more distant history.Their figures are looking not at the cumulative number of people coming in so far this year, but at the total number that came in in the 12 months to the end of June. And it so happens that there was a lull in crossings last autumn and winter, partly down to bad weather.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsBut here's what matters more than any of this. The sheer number of small boats migrants is a tiny, tiny sliver of the migration total in this country. Just over 30,000 people came over this way in the 12 months to June.Clearly, that's not nothing - and it's a total which is far higher than some years ago. But it's piddling in comparison with the overall migration total of around 1.3 million.It's tiny in comparison with the 547,000 people coming over to work, or the 530,000 coming over in that period to study.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerThese are the real story when it comes to migration: hundreds of thousands of students and workers, mostly from outside the EU, coming to the UK in almost unprecedented numbers.But the big news is that those numbers are now starting to come down.

11-09-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,Russian ship captured in satellite image 'delivering ballistic missiles from Iran',"Satellite imagery has captured a Russian-flagged cargo ship suspected of transporting ballistic missiles from Iran docked at a port in Russia a week ago.A Ukrainian source told Sky News the Port Olya 3 vessel had shipped around 220 short-range ballistic missiles via the Caspian Sea to Russia to be used for its war in Ukraine.The source said the ship arrived at the Russian port on 4 September.Ukraine war latest: Russia starts 'significant counteroffensive'Satellite imagery analysed by the Sky News Data & Forensics team pictures the vessel on that day at Port Olya in the region of Astrakhan, in southern Russia, by the Caspian Sea.Ship tracking data shows the Port Olya 3 had been at the Iranian port of Amirabad just six days earlier, on 29 August.After arriving in Russia, the Ukrainian source said it is believed the Fateh-360 ballistic missiles - with a range of more than 70 miles - were loaded on to a large cargo train.The image of the ship at the port - captured by a Maxar satellite - was taken at 0751 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) on 4 September.Two days later another satellite image shows the ship had left the port.No data has been shared since 29 August. Six days after the ship last shared its position it arrived at the Russian port.We regularly see ships turning off their tracking to conceal movements. AIS transponders are required by the International Maritime Organization on any ship weighing 300 gross tonnes or more.In the Caspian Sea, untraceable ships have become more common as Iran and Russia continue to trade weapons. This strategy has been labelled ""dark port calls"".The limited tracking data available shows the Port Olya 3 regularly travels between Iran and Russia.It is not clear where the ballistic missiles were taken once they arrived at the Russian port.The Ukrainian source said an assumption is that they will be sent to a military training ground called Ashuluk for tests and to enable further training before they are used on the battlefield.The revelations come after Anthony Blinken, the US secretary of state, announced on Tuesday that the US believes the Russian military has received shipments of Iranian Fatah-360 ballistic missiles.Iran and Russia have denied the claims.Mr Blinken said Russian troops have been trained on how to deploy the munitions and warned that Russian commanders ""will likely use them within weeks in Ukraine against Ukrainians"".Iran's Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi said on Wednesday that Tehran did not deliver any ballistic missiles to Russia, adding that sanctions imposed by the US and the E3 (UK, France and Germany) against his country are not a solution.Sky News and other news organisations reported on Saturday that the Kremlin had received the missiles in defiance of warnings from the West.It is a serious step-up in what is already a significant level of military assistance given by Iran to its ally, which until now had comprised of attack drones, ammunition and artillery shells - aid that had already triggered increased western sanctions and outrage.Mr Blinken called the supply of ballistic missiles a ""dramatic escalation"".Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerWashington and London subsequently issued a wave of new sanctions against Iran, including sanctioning a number of cargo ships accused of involvement in the transportation of weapons from Iran to Russia.The Port Olya 3 is among the ships on the latest US sanctions list.Beyond sanctions, expectations are growing that Iran's supply of ballistic missiles to Russia will prompt the US and the UK to allow Ukraine to fire American and British long-range missiles inside Russia.This has so far not been granted despite mounting pleas by Kyiv because of concerns about how Russia might respond.Read more:Iran 'sends hundreds of missiles to Russia'Analysis: Russia's links with Iran are growing strongerKeep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsMr Blinken and his British counterpart David Lammy are in Ukraine on Wednesday to talk with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about his request to use long-range missiles inside Russia.The outcome of the meeting will be shared with US President Joe Biden and Sir Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, before the two leaders are due to meet in Washington on Friday where any decision on the use of British and American long-range missiles inside Russia is widely expected to be made.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeResponding to the allegations about the supply of ballistic missiles, senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) commander, Brigadier Fazlollah Nozari, denied the claim, according to the Iranian Labour News Agency, as he branded it ""a kind of psychological warfare"".Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he had seen the report, but not all such reports were correct.",https://news.sky.com/story/russian-ship-captured-in-satellite-image-delivering-ballistic-missiles-from-iran-13212835
11-09-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,Who is favourite to win the US election? Follow the latest polls and play our game to predict who you think will win,"The presidential election on 5 November is set to be the tightest race since at least 2000.Kamala Harris currently holds a slender lead over Donald Trump, according to the latest polls.But the US election is not all about who wins the most votes overall, it's about who wins in the right states.How does the US election work?iIf we add up the votes in ""safe"" states that the candidates probably don't need to worry about so much, Harris is on 225 electoral college votes and Trump on 219, in their race to 270.Of the 94 votes left in the eight crucial swing states where the races are tight, Harris needs 45 to win the presidency and Trump needs 51.Harris is currently leading in a majority of those.Read analysis and follow reaction of the debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump our live blogBut the leads are narrow. All it takes is for Trump to turn fortunes around in any two of the larger states and he will reach the 51 he needs to win.After the debate on 10 September, Kamala Harris also retook the lead in the betting markets, but only by the narrowest of margins, reflecting a belief among punters that the race is very far from over.Predict who you think will win in each swing state and we'll tell you who the president will be if you're right.Swing statesWe can already be fairly confident of the result in lots of states. California and New York for example have voted Democrat at every election for the past 30 years.Texas is the same the other way around - they haven't voted for a Democrat since Jimmy Carter in 1976, almost 50 years ago. Only five states changed hands in 2020.That's why those eight states that could go either way are so very important.If Trump doesn't win in Pennsylvania, his route to victory becomes increasingly narrow - he would need to win at least four of the six biggest remaining states.If he does win there, however, he can become president with just two others.There is no recent polling in Nebraska s second district by pollsters recognised by our US partners NBC News, but that single electoral vote could make all the difference if other states go a certain way.If Trump wins Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan and loses North Carolina, Arizona, Wisconsin and Nevada, he would be stuck on 269 - Nebraska 2nd would take him over the line.What happens if it's a tie in the electoral college?iEach of the fifty states, plus Washington DC, holds their own vote for president which is independent from the others.Each state is worth an amount of ""electoral college votes"" - effectively points - related to the population of the state.California, the most populous US state, has 54 electoral college votes representing their 39 million population.Wyoming, the smallest US state, has three electoral college votes representing their 600,000 population.There are 538 ""points"" in total. To become president, a candidate must get to 270 (more than half). It doesn't matter what combination of states gets them there, but some routes are easier than others.In most states - all except Nebraska and Maine - the winning candidate in a state gets all of the electoral votes available.So if Donald Trump was to win Florida by a single vote, he would get all 30 of their electoral college votes, the same as if he got 100% of the popular vote there.In Nebraska, two votes are allocated to who wins the state overall, and one each to the candidate who wins in three districts of Nebraska - making five overall. It's the same in Maine but there are only four electoral college votes up for grabs there, so its other votes are split across two districts rather than three.Who is the bookies' favourite?We ve mostly spoken about the polls so far, but there s another often overlooked way to gauge the potential outcome of the election - by looking at where people are putting their money.Betting markets, unlike polls, are driven by people willing to back their predictions with real money. This means they reflect not just today s opinions but also the collective wisdom of people who are invested in the outcome about how things might change going forward.Sky News is tracking the odds of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump winning the 2024 election. We've translated the odds into percentages to reflect the implied probability of each candidate's victory.The percentage refers to the candidates' overall chance of winning, by whatever margin, not an implied vote share or electoral college split.Who is the people's favourite?Sometimes it's not about policy but just about whether you like one candidate more than another.Americans are more likely to find Donald Trump unfavourable than favourable, but he has had a recent (relative) jump in popularity.It's the reverse for Harris at the moment - she had a brief bounce after becoming the official candidate, but has since dropped to a level close to Trump's new high.As the election approaches, keep an eye on all these trackers to see the polls and betting markets' predictions evolve, and what they reveal about where the race to become president is going.The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

03-09-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,How IS-K group linked to Taylor Swift terror plot is increasing in strength and influence,"The international influence of Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K), a branch of the Islamic State, has been on the rise.The group has been linked to numerous attacks and planned attacks in 2024. The highest profile plots include a deadly attack on a concert hall in Moscow, foiled plans to disrupt three Taylor Swift concerts in Austria, and twin bombings in Iran.Sky News has analysed new data from the Centre for Information Resilience (CIR) that shows a sharp rise in propaganda produced by the group in the last two years. The content is also being disseminated in an increasing number of languages.As the amount of propaganda has increased, reaching audiences far beyond Afghanistan's borders, so has the number of international attacks and planned attacks, posing a growing threat to Western security.German officials recently said they have foiled planned IS-K attacks, as authorities in the country remain on high alert. In July, French officials said they uncovered several terrorist plots targeting the 2024 Paris Olympics. In the weeks leading up to the Games, IS-K's propaganda channels had published several posters inciting supporters to attack various locations in Paris during the event.Experts expect this trend of incitement to continue gaining traction and the UN has warned of IS-K's heightened threat levels across Europe.""The group is considered the greatest external terrorist threat to the continent,"" Vladimir Voronkov, the under-secretary-general for the UN's Office of Counter-Terrorism, said in a briefing in August.The Afghan wing of Islamic State (IS), commonly known as IS-K, ISIS-K or ISKP, has emerged as the terrorist organisation's most globally-minded affiliate.In addition to targeting its core audiences in South and Central Asia, specifically Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, the group has been gradually disseminating media in an increasing number of languages.""Recently, especially since the uptick in propaganda, we've seen a bigger focus on Central Asia and on Europe,"" said Ben den Braber, head of research for Afghan Witness, the team behind CIR's new data.One recent poster produced by the group's in-house media outlet announced the broadcast of their content in Urdu, adding to the array of languages it already publishes including Pashto, Persian, Tajik, Uzbek, Russian, Turkish, Azerbaijani, English and Arabic.Global ambitionsIS-K first emerged in 2015, when their primary focus was to gain territory in Afghanistan to help establish a caliphate, or a territory controlled by a single IS ruler.The K in its name refers to Khorasan, a province in Afghanistan that historically encompasses parts of modern-day Iran, Central Asia, Afghanistan and Pakistan.After US troops pulled out of Afghanistan in 2021 and the Taliban regained power, the number of attacks and influence by IS-K inside the country has been dwindling, according to data gathered by CIR's Afghan Witness team.The group has increased its strength since the US withdrawal and ramped up international operations, despite the Taliban's campaign to crackdown on IS-K in Afghanistan.""The threat posed by [IS-K] has grown with significant terrorist attacks outside of Afghanistan, notably in Moscow on 22 March, and with increased threat levels in Europe and other areas,"" the UN Security Council recently wrote in a report.The data backs this up. There's been a significant uptick in attacks and arrests of IS-K-linked individuals outside Afghanistan since 2022.""The really interesting piece of this is not that the Taliban's been able to limit attacks in Afghanistan,"" said Colin Clarke, director of research at the Soufan Group, a New York-based security and intelligence firm.""It's been the adaptability of IS,"" he added. ""They made that transition seamlessly. And they've stuck with it.""There was a noticeable shift in IS-K's propaganda narratives after the Taliban regained power in Afghanistan, said Dr Amira Jadoon, assistant professor of political science at Clemson University and the author of a forthcoming book about IS-K.""There's still the vilification of the Taliban. But we see a shift towards talking about different issues and grievances of different communities,"" she said.Aside from focusing their content on successful attacks and capitalising on local issues in key countries like Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to rally supporters, the group publishes propaganda that touches on wider global conflicts.This is seen by scholars as a way for IS-K to capitalise on the feeling of hostility in the Muslim world, and to take advantage of anti-Western sentiment, exacerbated by the war in Gaza.""The goal became here to show how [they] are such a broad platform that anyone can join,"" said Dr Jadoon.Shift in strategyIn August, a disrupted plan to attack three Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna was the latest high-profile international plot linked to IS-K. Austrian authorities say the main suspect had pledged allegiance to the group and had been consuming and sharing propaganda online.The suspects in the foiled Vienna attacks intended to kill ""tens of thousands"" of people, according to the US's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerInstances like this and the thwarted attacks in Paris during the Olympics, for example, make up a fraction of the planned attacks in Europe this year, which experts estimate to have been at least half a dozen to date.The group is also responsible for several successful plots this year.In March, gunmen attacked and set fire to Crocus City Hall, a concert venue in Moscow. The incident left nearly 140 people dead. Four men of Tajik origin were arrested.While IS-K didn't directly claim responsibility, they posted a video in one of their channels from one of the attackers' phones while they conducted the rampage, and have implied in other posts that they were the ones behind the attack.The violence in Moscow was also preceded by a string of anti-Russian messages on IS-K channels online.""The propaganda is somewhat of a foreshadowing of the area of interest for the organisation,"" said Mr den Braber of CIR.After the attack, the group published a flyer with text that read ""After Moscow, Who is the Next?"", along with images and the names of various large European cities.At this stage, IS and its Afghan branch are trying to gain prominence on the international stage by generating media attention to recruit supporters and, crucially, raise money, according to experts.In January, the group was linked to double suicide bombings at a memorial service in Kerman, Iran, which killed over 100 people, and a gun attack at a church in Istanbul.""What they're after is the media exposure. Why? Because another thing that's changed in recent years is that IS lost its big donors,"" said Dr Antonio Giustozzi, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute.Members of his research team are part of several IS-K Telegram channels and WhatsApp groups, and were told that the Iran attack helped IS-K raise quite a lot of money from donors, often sent using crypto.""Their goal is to kill large numbers of civilians to garner attention,"" said Mr Clarke, who runs research at The Soufan Centre.""These kinds of terror plots are really intended to generate momentum for the group to make it a household name once again, and with that comes recruitment and donations.""Taylor Swift's arguably the most recognisable and famous pop star in the world. If they were successful in attacking that concert, similar to the way the Ariana Grande Manchester bombing took place, ISIS would have enjoyed weeks, if not months of unfettered propaganda, which helps buoy the group and give them momentum.""Even foiled plots like the planned attacks on the Swift concerts in Austria, he said, are a win.Read more:What is IS-K and why would it target Russia?UK should 'absolutely' be concerned about IS-K after Moscow attackHard to trackAs well as distributing content through their own media, content is shared widely on social media platforms like Meta, X and encrypted messaging apps like Telegram.Experts say that IS-K encourages its supporters around the world to create their own propaganda that aligns with its position.IS-K appears to be inciting attacks from afar. A lot of propaganda calls on self-radicalised supporters through online channels to carry out unsophisticated plots against civilians, rather than planning directed attacks, which are defined by sending highly trained individuals to hit specific locations.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for free""Self-radicalisation is one of the key threats with all this propaganda that they put out there,"" said Dr Jadoon, who's authoring a book about IS-K.'Incited' or inspired attacks, Jadoon says, can be very hard to track. ""If someone is just absorbing content and not really engaging in any way, then it makes it harder to detect,"" she added.""With directed attacks, there are more opportunities for law-enforcement to detect unusual activity on groups. There's more chance there will be a paper trail.""Another obstacle in tracking IS-K content and potential plots is the fact that social media platforms have strict censorship rules.Mr den Braber says content moderation is the biggest difficulty for his team in keeping on top of different communication channels, adding that old IS-K chat rooms are taken down and new ones pop up every day.Future plotsKeep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsCounter-terrorism experts say Western intelligence has a good penetration of these online networks and is disrupting them frequently and early.But some warn that because agencies in the West are overburdened, something could slip through the cracks.""There's so much going on in the world so there are gaps in intelligence and law enforcement monitoring,"" said Lucas Webber, senior threat intelligence analyst at Tech Against Terrorism, a UN initiative that tracks terrorist activities online.""It's going to be difficult to prevent one or more attacks slipping through at this point.""The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

16-08-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,"Bricks, burning arrows, and burglary: Who was involved in the riots and what sentences have they got?","Around 90 adults have been sentenced so far for their part in the recent riots which gripped towns and cities in England and Northern Ireland.Eight of those have received custodial sentences of three years or more, while three-quarters of people have got more than a year of jail time.The severity of sentences ranges from community orders and fines at the lower end, to the longest term so far of six years for David Wilkinson, 48, for his role in the Hull disorder.He was a prominent member of the ""baying mob"" which forced three terrified Romanian men from their car.John Honey, 25, who went viral online for his looting rampage of Lush, O2 and Shoezone in Hull while wearing an England flag shirt, received four years and eight months behind bars.There was also a hefty sentence of three years and four months for 44-year-old Gareth Metcalfe, for his involvement in rioting outside a mosque in his hometown of Southport on 30 July.Metcalfe, who the prosecution describes as having entrenched racist views, was at the forefront of the violence in Southport, and has 21 previous convictions including for racially and religiously aggravated offences.Who was involved in the rioting?Fewer than 5% of those sentenced are women, with the majority of offenders (70%) being men aged in their 20s-40s.Nine adults under the age of 20 have been sentenced.Among them, the longest jail terms were for 18-year-old Kenzie Roughley and 19-year-old Drew Jarvis.Roughley was sentenced to two years and four months for kicking a police van outside an asylum hotel in Rotherham, while Jarvis received a three-year term for hurling bricks and lit arrows at police during the same riot on 4 August.This only includes sentences of adult offenders who have been named in court. Convicted children under the age of 18 have not been named for legal reasons, including boys as young as 12 years old.Only five of those sentenced so far are aged 60 or older.At 69, the oldest is William Nelson Morgan who has received a sentence of two years and eight months for his part in the disorder on 3 August in his local area of Walton, which resulted in the destruction of Spellow Library, whilst being in possession of a wooden cosh.Sentences were handed down for 104 offences, as 17 offenders were charged with more than one offence.Over half (52%) of those were charged with the public order offence of violent disorder, and a further 17% related to charges of affray or other public order offences, including racially aggravated harassment.One in 10 charges, where sentences were handed down, related to online communications. This includes 53-year-old ""keyboard warrior"" Julie Sweeney's 15-month term for publishing material to stir up racial hatred.She posted on Facebook: ""Don't protect the mosques, blow the mosque up with the adults in it"".More sentencing to comeAs of 15 August, 437 people in England and Wales had been charged with offences relating to the violent unrest and disorder which broke out in the wake of the Southport stabbings at the end of July.Some 20 additional charges have been made by the CPS in the past 24 hours.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsBe the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeSo far, no one has been sentenced on the more serious charge of 'rioting', but two people have been charged with the offence - Kieran Usher of Sunderland and an unnamed 15 year-old boy.Around 40 people have been arrested and charged with offences related to the disorder in Northern Ireland, including an 11-year-old boy.

16-08-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,Israel-Hamas conflict: Deadly settler attack was 'not an isolated incident',"One Palestinian was killed and several injured by a group of Israeli settlers in the West Bank village of Jit last night.Residents said around 100 masked settlers entered the village, fired live ammunition and set fire to homes and cars.Videos of the attack, verified by Sky News, show groups of masked individuals attacking properties in the south of Jit.One video captured by a security camera, and timestamped 7.49pm, shows three settlers dressed in dark clothes smash the windows of a car parked outside a house before setting it alight and running off.A number of settlers then returned, with some throwing objects and carrying a chair.A later video, taken from the same location, shows at least eight Israeli settlers climbing a hill less than 1km from the house. Residents watch from the balcony as the car continues to burn.But the chaos wasn't limited to the streets. One video shows two settlers in a veranda dousing a sofa in liquid.Seconds later, one of them sets the sofa on fire.The attack has been condemned by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said he is treating it with the ""utmost severity"". An IDF spokesperson told Sky News that they had apprehended an Israeli for questioning over the incident.There are multiple conflicting accounts of when the incident began, and how long it took for the IDF to arrive. The attacks took place just 2km from an Israeli military base in the nearby settlement of Kdumim.The IDF says the attack began at around 8pm, and that its forces entered the village ""within minutes"" of hearing about it.Sky News spoke to the owner of the burning car, Dr Ibrahim Sedi.Ibrahim, 55, also says that the attack began at 8pm, but says the soldiers only arrived after an hour. Once they arrived, he says, the situation was quickly resolved.""They pushed the settlers away, even shot in the air to frighten them. They helped us - they tried to put out the fire on the two cars.""The soldiers are different people, they are friendly, they tried to help us.""Local resident Sufian Jit, however, says that the attack began at 6pm - and that residents were left without military assistance for two hours.""What can I say? It was like a war launched against us. There were more than 100 settlers.""Footage of the aftermath of the attack shows the charred remains of a living room in a Palestinian home.Dr Ibrahim Sedi identified the man killed as a 23-year old relative, who was outside the family home defending it from the attackers.""We were about 18 people in the house. My family, we are eight, and ten of my relatives were with me. I was making a meal for them.""The people who were close to him told us that one of the settlers shot him from about 15 metres only. They [the settlers] were hiding between trees.""An IDF spokesperson said the military has opened an investigation into the incident.""The IDF condemns incidents of this type and the rioters, who harm security, law and order, and divert the IDF and the security forces from their main mission of thwarting terrorism and protecting the security of civilians,"" the spokesperson said.'Not an isolated attack'There have been at least 27 reported settler attacks in Jit since 2018, according to the conflict monitoring organisation ACLED.UN human rights spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani said that the incident was ""not an isolated attack"".""This was a direct consequence of Israel's settlement policy and the prevailing climate of impunity,"" she said.Tensions have risen in the West Bank since 7 October last year, when a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel killed 1,200 Israelis.Israel's subsequent invasion of Gaza has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza.This year is set to be the deadliest on record for Palestinians in the West Bank. As of 11 August, 268 Palestinians have been killed, compared to 173 at the same point last year.Violence against Palestinians has increasingly come not just from Israeli soldiers, however, but also from civilian settlers.Since the war began, the UN has recorded around 12,500 attacks by extremist Israeli settlers targeting West Bank Palestinians or their property.That's an average of four attacks every day - compared to three per day before the war started. More than seven Palestinians are being injured or killed in these attacks each week.Since 7 October, around 1,500 Palestinians - half of them children - have been displaced by a mixture of access restrictions and increased settler violence, according to the UN.On Friday, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that 100 Palestinians had fled their homes in the West Bank community of Umm Jamal due to threats and harassment from nearby settlers.""This needs to stop, and the key would be accountability for perpetrators,"" according to Ms Shamdasani.""There had been very few investigations, and even those had not concluded with justice for victims and their families. There was clearly a state responsibility in this regard.""Israeli human rights group Yesh Din has tracked the progress of 1,535 complaints related to settler violence since 2005. Of those, just 12 have led to full convictions.Around 500,000 Israeli citizens live in the West Bank, with a further 220,000 in East Jerusalem.Israel has long claimed historic rights over parts of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and says Jewish settlements have existed in the area for centuries.However, under international law, these territories are considered occupied Palestinian land, and the construction of settlements is prohibited - a position affirmed by the governments of the UK, EU, and US. Despite this, they have continued to expand.Read more from Sky News:'We may have something' on ceasefire deal, says BidenTurkish parliament descends into fistfightHagit Ofran, co-director of Settlement Watch, a project of Israeli NGO Peace Now, says that settlement construction has increased ""dramatically"" since 7 October.""We are seeing 30 new settlements already. And a lot of Palestinian communities being evicted or running away from settler violence.""Following its win in the December 2022 election, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government made the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank a top priority.The coalition agreement was led by a commitment to ""advance and develop a settlement in all parts of the land of Israel"" including ""Judea and Samaria"" - the biblical names for the West Bank.In 1987, there were just 60,000 Israeli settlers living in the West Bank (excluding East Jerusalem). By 2005, this had quadrupled to 247,300, and by 2021 it had reached 465,400.Further expansion is planned. Last year, Israel advanced plans for a record 12,349 new settlement housing units.This year, Israel has declared a record 2,419 hectares of the West Bank ""state land"" - a designation which allows for the construction of settlements. That is more than all state land declared in the previous two decades.""This is how the government of Israel is taking over land in the West Bank,"" says Hagit Ofran, of Settlement Watch.""They want to, on the one hand, prevent Palestinians from using land and on the other hand allow the establishment of settlements. So, they need to take over the land. And the legal acrobatics that Israel is doing in order to take land is this declaration of state land.""At the same time, Israeli authorities are demolishing Palestinian buildings at the highest rate in recent history. Data from the UN shows that 963 structures have been demolished this year, displacing 2,001 people (including 876 children). At this point last year, 644 structures had been demolished.Several government ministers are settlers themselves, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir.In a statement on a fatal settler attack in August, Ben Gvir said of the alleged killer: ""My policy is clear. Anyone who defends himself against rock-throwing should get a medal of honour.""The other assailant in that case was later sanctioned by the UK for his role in fomenting settler violence. More than a dozen Israeli settlers have been sanctioned by countries including the US and UK in recent months.Last night's attack in Jit prompted an unusually strong condemnation from far-right figures within Israel's government.Finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, who has previously defended violent settlers and railed against US sanctions, described the attacks as an ""anarchist criminal violence"".""I think it has to do with the international sanctions and the ICJ case,"" says Mr Ofran. ""So, maybe they are now starting to try and show as if they are doing something. But I don't see that it's a big dramatic change in policy.""For Palestinians, such words are likely to be little comfort as the violence continues to escalate.""We never did anything wrong to the settlers or the soldiers - the people in my village are friendly people,"" says Dr Ibrahim Sedi, whose cars were burned in the attack on Jit this Thursday.""In the past the settlers came, but they used to push people away from their land - that's all. This time, they were very frightening.""The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

15-08-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,"Gaza conflict: Thousands remain unidentified as death toll reaches 40,000 ","More than 40,000 people have now been killed in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry.A further 92,401 people have sustained injuries, health officials in the Hamas-run enclave say, meaning one in every 17 people in Gaza has been killed or injured since the war began (5.8%).Fidaa, 39, and her children were sleeping in a school in central Gaza when the shells hit. Her brother Yousef, 30, and husband Abed, 43, were sleeping in the nearby men's section.Hours earlier, they had all been eating together in the courtyard - ""chatting, playing, telling jokes,"" Fidaa says.She ran downstairs to see fire ""covering the sky"". The men's section had been hit.""Imagine - at that moment my children ran towards the fire to help their father and uncle,"" she says.""They were charred corpses and body parts. I wasn't able to give them a proper burial.""Ten months of war between Israel and Hamas have devastated the Gaza Strip. An estimated 59% of buildings have been damaged or destroyed, including more than 215,000 homes.It's not clear how many of those killed have been civilians. On Thursday evening, IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said that Israel had so far ""eliminated"" 17,000 Palestinian militants.Gaza's health ministry doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count of the dead. Of those which have been identified, however, 60% are women, children or elderly people.The Israeli and US governments have cast doubt on the statistics produced by Gaza's health ministry, which remains under the control of Hamas.In May, Israeli foreign minister Israel Katz described them as ""fake data from a terrorist organization"".In response to its critics, the health ministry has repeatedly published the names, ages and ID numbers of all identified fatalities.""That's important because those [ID numbers] were originally assigned by the Israelis,"" says Professor Michael Spagat, chair of Every Casualty Counts, an independent civilian casualty monitoring organisation.""So, the Israelis can easily check to make sure that those are real people that are in the population register that the Israelis maintain.""When Sky News asked the IDF if it had performed any such checks, its spokesman declined to comment.Thousands of fatalities, however, remain unidentified - without names or ID numbers.Speaking to Sky News, the man in charge of collecting Gaza's mortality statistics says his team have been working hard to put names to these bodies.""We're facing a great challenge over the credibility and transparency of what we publish,"" says Zaher Al Wahaidi, director of the health ministry's Health Information Centre (HIC).How the system collapsedBefore the war, the HIC was able to track deaths in real-time via a computer network which connected hospitals across the Gaza Strip.The system had proven accurate during previous conflicts, its figures tallying closely with estimates later produced by the UN and IDF.""The way that the health ministry has reported deaths in past conflicts deaths is quite strong - much stronger than other settings that I've worked in,"" says Professor Paul Spiegel, director of the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns Hopkins University.Mr Al Wahaidi says the system collapsed following Israeli raids on Gaza City's Al Shifa and Al Rantisi hospitals last November, raids which destroyed the HIC's data centres.In the south of Gaza, hospitals lost access to the civil registry - the national database of names, ID numbers and birth dates. These details now had to be entered manually, which meant that thousands of ID numbers, names and dates of birth were missing or entered incorrectly.The situation was far worse in the north, where there were no computer systems at all. Staff relied on pens and paper to record the details of the dead. When the hospital was particularly busy, this was impossible.Instead, a simple headcount was taken by the hospital spokesperson. Bodies were tagged and photographed for later identification.As a result, the number of unidentified fatalities rose rapidly. In March, 81% of all new additions to the death toll were unidentified.In the health ministry's reports, these body counts were attributed to ""reliable sources"" - a phrase which has previously been mistranslated as ""reliable media sources"".""It's not from journalists,"" says Mr Al Wahaidi. ""We don't depend on any press sources for data - this is the policy of the Ministry of Health.""The situation in the north only began to improve in February, as computer systems were gradually restored.It took many months longer until Gaza's hospitals were able to reconnect to the central database of the HIC, and send detailed data automatically.Now, all of Gaza's major functioning hospitals have been reconnected.Identifying the deadMany of these hospitals have since been able to supply data on people who were killed during the communications blackout.For hospitals in the north, this has come in the form of paper notes which, Mr Al Wahaidi says, took two months to digitise. He and his team have also had to fix thousands of entries containing typos or missing data.Sky News analysis found that the number of entries with missing or invalid ID numbers reached as high as 2,769 in early April. By the end of July, however, it had fallen to just 313.More difficult, says Mr Al Wahaidi, have been those fatalities for which no information is available.To identify these cases, Mr Al Wahaidi and his team have relied on an entirely new system - one which allows the families of those killed to obtain death certificates without a body.The families are required to fill out an online form with the details of the deceased, and to say whether their body was received by a hospital.Data from July shows that 55% of fatalities reported via the form had passed through a hospital but were not identified. A further 22% were buried without reaching hospital, while 23% were missing or presumed to be under the rubble.If a death is confirmed, Mr Al Wahaidi and his team add it to their database. If the body passed through a hospital, one entry is also removed from the tally of unidentified deaths.For a death to be confirmed, however, the family must first put their case before a judge.""All residents of northern Gaza must go to a judicial committee in Gaza City. All residents of southern Gaza go to one in Nasser Hospital, in Khan Younis,"" says Mr Al Wahaidi.""After that, they're referred to the public prosecutor to verify that the event occurred [and that] the one they're registering was actually a martyr, and not a natural death.""A total of 6,187 deaths had been confirmed via the online form as of 6 August.Collecting this data has allowed the HIC to put names to many of the previously unidentified bodies, and to provide the families of the deceased with death certificates.By 31 March, the number of unidentified fatalities had reached 15,070 - 46% of all deaths. As of 6 August, this had more than halved to 7,200 (18%).""It's all very challenging and chaotic and you would expect there to be plenty of mistakes,"" says Prof Spagat.""But it looks like they're in there fighting the battle to record all this information, and they seem to be doing it in a serious and reasonable way.""It may be years before the true number of deaths in Gaza can be determined. Israel has denied almost all access to Gaza by international journalists and investigators.Mr Al Wahaidi says the number his team are providing is intended to be a conservative figure, based only on those deaths which have been confirmed by medics or by a judicial process.""We're still missing many people that haven't been counted,"" says Prof Spiegel, of Johns Hopkins University.""And the health ministry is only reporting trauma deaths. There's clearly [been] an exacerbation of indirect deaths - cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, maternal deaths. If anything, I think it's an underestimate,"" he adds.The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

14-08-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,The Islamic State supporters exploiting TikTok's 'sounds' feature,"A TikTok user appears in a photograph holding two children. In another, he is in a gym, training with a worn-out punching bag.Visually, the TikTok post appears innocuous, but the audio is not.It consists of a speech given in Arabic, laid over an excerpt of vocal music known as a nasheed.Nasheeds are common across the Islamic world and are not inherently tied to any ideology - but this one was composed in support of Islamic State.Read more:Warning of Islamic State's growing resurgenceThe horror of life as an ISIS sex slaveAnd because of the way TikTok works, related content is easy to find. Click on the song and it works as an audio hashtag, showing all the other videos that use this song.Just a touch or click away is much more graphic content.439 videos are linked on TikTok through their shared use of this sound. Multiple posts feature pictures of notorious IS figures, including the executioner Mohammed Emwazi, more commonly known in Western media as Jihadi John.Some show scenes from IS-controlled areas of Iraq and Syria, others include messages screenshotted from the group's official media outlet.In one, a masked figure is shown pointing a gun at a prisoner wearing the notorious orange uniform worn by the group's victims in the execution videos it routinely published at its height.In effect, TikTok users are able signpost to similar content while avoiding the use of text-based methods such as captions and hashtags that can be more easily monitored by moderators.Some of the accounts are likely normal people ""trying to be edgy"", says Meili Criezis, Program Associate at the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab.""But there are other accounts that are more purposeful and in the strategy. And so from those accounts, you see a more consistent pattern. You'll have also a lot of content where the person is trying to disseminate IS propaganda quite purposefully, quite strategically.""IS nasheeds on TikTokThis example, titled ""We Have The Swords,"" is far from the only Islamic State Nasheed used as a sound by TikTok users.One of the most used IS nasheeds viewed by Sky News on TikTok was an edit of ""Dawlati Baqiyah."" The song addresses the losses inflicted on IS forces by the US-led coalition in defiant terms.Thousands of posts used this as a soundtrack before the sound was removed by TikTok.A recording of Qamat Al Dawla, released by one of the organisation's official media outlets Ajnad Media Foundation, remains available on the platform, and is attached to 364 videos.While some posts using it may have been removed by moderators, this sound has remained on TikTok since at least October 2023.A recording of another nasheed released by Ajnad Media Foundation in 2013 has been available on the platform as a sound since at least October 2021. It was the most popular sound viewed by Sky News.Attached to over 14,300 videos, its lyrics celebrate the actions of IS fighters, stating ""The Islamic State has arisen by the blood of the righteous"".Unclear motivations of individual usersAccording to Ms Criezis, regardless of the individual poster's intent, content using this type of audio can easily lead users to genuine extremist content, as all they have to do is click on a sound and be exposed to straightforwardly pro-IS propaganda.For extremists, pro-IS nasheeds being reposted by unsuspecting users can likely be understood as a win in itself, according to Ms Criezis. ""Sometimes I think they just like the idea of the sound itself being mainstreamed and people not even knowing what it is,"" she said.Moderation is an uphill battleOn the challenge faced by social media networks such as TikTok seeking to censor such content, Ms Criezis described it as an ""uphill battle,"" largely because IS supporters have proved to be adaptable in responding to censorship.After Sky News presented its findings to TikTok, the videos were taken down.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsA TikTok spokesperson said: ""We stand firmly against violent extremism and have banned all of the accounts and content flagged to us.

11-08-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,Fewer world records were broken in Paris than at other recent Olympics. Are we reaching peak sports performance? ,"After three weeks of blood, sweat and tears, with the world's most talented athletes gathering to battle for their place in the history books, the Paris Olympics is finally drawing to a close.As always, there were exceptional feats of athleticism on display, and some athletes propelled themselves further and faster than any had before, breaking 17 world records at the event.However, this does represent a decrease since the previous games in Tokyo in which 20 world records were broken.In fact, the number has been in decline since Beijing 2008, when 30 world records were broken.The Paris games were the lowest figure in 20 years despite an increase in the number of events.The secrets are out""We've probably reached a little bit of a point of diminishing returns now,"" says Dr Thomas Brownlee, associate professor in applied sport sciences at the School of Sport, Exercise and Rehabilitation Sciences at the University of Birmingham.""After the Atlanta games in 1996, people really stepped their game up and national sporting institutes really looked into how they could make these big improvements.""That was across everything, be it how people trained, how people recovered, nutrition, strategies, training specifics, talent identification... 20 years ago, nutrition wasn't really considered at all. But now everyone's doing it.""He added: ""At the same time, there were big technological advantages - think of Dave Brailsford for British cycling and jokes about 'extra round wheels', all that kind of stuff.""In the following games, all the way up to London, the fruit of those labours were really reaped and you saw those massive improvements.""What we're seeing now is that everyone's kind of catching up and doing similar stuff. The secrets are out a little bit.""GB's women cyclists smashed record three times overIndeed, continuing advances in cycling - whether the technology of the bike itself or in track design - mean it is an area where improvements continue to be made.With five toppled, the velodrome was the arena in which the largest number of world records were broken in Paris.That's excluding several events where a record was overturned repeatedly, such as Team GB's women's cycling team smashing the team sprint record three times over in successive rounds on their way to gold.A combination of factors created ideal conditions for cyclists this year, including the heat within the arena itself making the air less dense, a fine-tuned track shape and surface, and ever-improving equipment.In contrast, there had been speculation that conditions in the aquatics arena were less than ideal, with reports that the Olympic pool's relatively shallow depth of 7ft may have slowed down athletes due to its effect of increasing turbulence in the pool.Nevertheless, four swimming world records were surpassed. Although this is slightly below expectations leading up to the events, and lower than the number set at Tokyo 2020 (six) and Rio 2016 (eight) it was more than in any other sport besides cycling, and a continuation in swimming records overtaking those set in 2008 and 2009, before a ban on controversial LZR swimsuit technology was imposed.The sports with the biggest potential for performance improvements will continue to be those where there's more technology in use for the event, says Dr Brownlee.""The kinds of sports where equipment can be employed might be where you continue to see the improvements. Other ones would be less established Olympic sports, where you have funding injections,"" he says.Longest standing recordsSome disciplines, particularly in athletics, have experienced more of a slowdown in new records being set, with some very long-lasting records in particular proving difficult to budge.Among the longest-standing athletics records of events that are still competed today are those in sprinting and middle-distance running.""There are some world records that do have question marks around them, from before the 90s in particular. There exists some scepticism around the practices leading to how they were obtained,"" says Dr Brownlee.""We hope that the advances in sports science and technology will eventually allow athletes to surpass them. We've seen a couple of people getting close to some of those records already.""Team GB's Keely Hodgkinson has the 41 year old 800m record firmly in her sights, following her Paris gold medal victory.""I think that those gaps will be closed, so hopefully in time there's no world records with potential question marks next to them,"" Dr Brownlee says.But sometimes it is just a case of exceptional individuals at the top of their game, he adds.""Usain Bolt is an obvious example, as well as some of the men's jump world records.""USA's Mike Powell's 1991 long jump of 8.95m, Cuba's Javier Sotomayor's 1993 high jump of 2.45m, and Great Britain's Jonathan Edwards' triple jump of 18.29m all remain unbroken to date.Pole vaulting records, on the other hand, continue to be toppled at pace by Sweden's Armand Duplantis, who has broken the world record nine times since 2020.He has raised the bar by 1cm each time - perhaps a savvy tactic considering athletes are awarded $100,000 ( 78,700) every time they break the world record. He made it to 6.25m in Paris, but with some space between him and the bar there is speculation that he has yet to reach his limit.And Ukrainian Yaroslava Mahuchikh overturned a long-standing jump record earlier this year, beating Bulgaria's Stefka Kostadinova's 36 year old women's high jump record by 1cm to reach 2.1m.Catching up to speedsDespite these records remaining undefeated, there has been a trend of a larger number of athletes catching up to speeds that would have landed them in medal positions in previous Olympics.In the thrilling men's 100m sprint final, USA's Noah Lyles took gold with a time of 9.784 seconds, just a fraction ahead of Jamaica's Kishane Thompson (9.789 seconds). But all eight men finished in under 10 seconds in a wind-legal race - making it the fastest in history.Botswana's Letsile Tebogo's time of 9.86 seconds, which landed him in sixth place in Paris, would have earned him a bronze medal in Tokyo and silver in Rio.Are we reaching the peak?Despite the apparent slowdown, we're still a way off reaching the peak of human performance, Dr Brownlee says.""I don't think that we are fully plateauing. Over the next 10-20 years we will see improvements with a better understanding of genetics to consider an individual athlete's needs.""What nutrition they need, or how they recover better, exactly how much sleep they need, exactly how they should be training. Really enabling that individualisation and squeezing each last per cent of improvement.""And the technology [sportswear and sporting equipment] will continue to come on in leaps and bounds, as well as track surfaces continuing to improve.""Optimisation has still got a way to go yet.""The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

08-08-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,Far-right outnumbers anti-racist movement when it comes to social media posts and engagement,"An analysis of social media data by Sky News shows that the far-right anti-immigrant movement has had far greater reach and popularity across several social media platforms than the pro-immigrant anti-racist movement in the past week.Anti-racist organisers, led in large part by the groups Stand Up To Racism and Hope Not Hate, have mobilised to counteract the right-wing demonstrations that began last week, in response to the attack in Southport that left three children dead on 29 July.To compare the two sides' online discourse, we looked at posts that mention at least one of three hashtags often used by the far-right movement, versus posts that mention at least one of three hashtags often used by the anti-racist movement.UK riots latest: Counter-protesters gather ahead of feared unrestData from social media monitoring tool Talkwalker shows that posts using anti-immigrant hashtags - #enoughisenough, #farrightthugsunite, or #TwoTier - spiked over the weekend on 3 August, when far-right riots spread across the UK.These posts outnumbered those that used hashtags that were pro-immigration in nature.Two-tier policing is a phrase that has been used to suggest that police have been more heavy-handed with people on the right of the political spectrum.In the days that followed, the number of posts using these hashtags diminished, but as more protests are expected, this could just as quickly tick back up.Data also shows that posts that used anti-immigrant hashtags were engaged with approximately four million times between 29 July and 7 August.Posts that mention #RefugeesWelcome, #AsylumSeekersWelcome or #noracismnofascism were engaged with just over 22,000 times, in comparison.This suggests that a week after the Southport attack, far-right protesters are organising and convening on public online platforms in far greater numbers than anti-racists.Read more:Why are people rioting across the UK?Shops urged to close early over riot fearsExplained: Musk v StarmerKeep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsSky News analysis of Telegram channels and X shows that out of 39 locations where far-right protests were expected to take place, 21 counter-protests were planned.But on Wednesday evening, the crowds of anti-racist protesters in Brighton and the London neighbourhoods of Walthamstow and Lewisham - some of the places where anti-immigration demonstrations were expected - outweighed far-right rioters.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerBe the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for free",https://news.sky.com/story/far-right-outnumbers-anti-racist-movement-when-it-comes-to-social-media-posts-and-engagement-13192784
06-08-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,How the far right hijacked Southport protests,"Protests sparked by the killing of three girls in Southport have spiralled into UK-wide riots now hijacked by the far right.Warning: Contains graphic content some readers may find distressing.By tracking Telegram channels used by far-right activists and groups and analysing online rhetoric on platforms like X, Sky News has found that over the past week protests have shifted in focus from the Southport stabbings to anti-immigration riots with Islamophobic rhetoric.UK riots latestThe government has come under pressure to address online misinformation. In response to the riots, Sir Keir Starmer said the criminal law  applies online as well as offline . X owner Elon Musk has been quick to retaliate against the politician's comments, highlighting divisions that are spreading far beyond Southport.It comes a week after three children were killed in an attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport. Since then false information that the suspect was a radical Islamist migrant has spread online.Tweets shift from Southport to protestsOver the past week data from social media monitoring tool TalkWalker shows that tweets online have shifted from Southport to protests reflecting the changing focus of right-wing groups in particular.Following online speculation about the suspect's identity and false claims that he is an immigrant and Muslim, we chose to focus our searches on the language used within the speculative claims.Two days after the stabbing, tweets relating to Southport and various terms relating to Muslims and immigration began to decrease.But there was a notable increase in tweets relating to both 'protest' and various terms relating to Muslims and immigration which spiked from Friday and over the weekend - as a number of riots took place across the UK.Sky News has seen multiple messages in various Telegram groups since last Thursday promoting protests - many of these have shared posters for riots at mosques.Anti-immigrant sentiment was not only clear online but at the protests themselves. One video taken in Hull on Saturday shows protesters shouting: ""We want our country back"".Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerMisinformation spreading onlineMisinformation on social media platforms raises questions for platforms like X.Former leader of the defunct anti-Islam English Defence League, Tommy Robinson, tweeted a video taken from the riots in Hanley, Stoke, on Saturday falsely claiming that two  British men  had been ""stabbed by Muslims"".Thirty minutes after this video was shared by Robinson, Staffordshire Police issued a statement saying that two men had been ""injured"" but ""no stabbings"" had been reported to police ""despite videos fuelling speculation on social media"".The force said the men were injured by a ""blunt object that was thrown"".Robinson s tweet which is still on X has almost one million views and was shared thousands of times. As a high-profile far-right figure, his online involvement demonstrates how false information can be amplified on X.While he clarified there were no reports of stabbings six hours after his original post - the tweet has not been flagged by X and his clarification was viewed 170k times - significantly less than the false claim he first shared.Contacted by Sky News, a spokesperson for Urban Scoop, a media platform which Robinson advertises in his bio on X, said: ""The 'stabbing' post you're referring to was corrected here in light of information shared by police.""As for the repost about a migrant with a gun in the hotel, that was a repost of someone else. It's hard to say what the migrant was holding in the window, it can't be verified either way so that 'repost' has been taken down.""X rules state that users must not ""share synthetic, manipulated, or out-of-context media that may deceive or confuse people and lead to harm"".Sky News has asked the platform why a community note has not been added to the post to show Robinson's original claim that two men had been stabbed was not true. The platform didn't respond at the time of publication.Beyond the platform's guidelines, X owner Elon Musk reinstated Robinson's account in November 2023 after he was banned for ""hateful conduct"". Musk has repeatedly been criticised for the spread of disinformation on X since he took charge.The billionaire has responded to a number of tweets regarding the riots. On Sunday, he tweeted a comment that read ""civil war is inevitable"", in response to a video re-posted by a conservative influencer, showing disorder during one of the protests. No justification  for Musk commentsSir Keir responded to Musk s post, with the prime minister s official spokesperson commenting:  There is no justification for comments like that.""Anyone who is whipping up violence online will face the full force of the law. Online platforms have a responsibility.""Sir Keir also posted a video of himself on X talking about clamping down on the riots. In the video's comments, Musk didn't hesitate to reply to the politician's statement, saying: ""Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?""His post was viewed more than half a million times within an hour of posting.Telegram messages show tactics changingSky News has monitored more than six Telegram groups since the attack happened which have organised and discussed riots across the country.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsWhile some mosques were targeted last week, many locations of the riots included town halls and other civic buildings. However, Sky News has seen a list of 39 locations for protests set to take place this week - all of which are either immigration centres or immigration service buildings.Telegram s Terms of Service states that users must not use the platform to  promote violence on publicly viewable Telegram channels .In response to Sky News' request for comment, Telegram said their terms of service explicitly forbid calls to violence.""The channels publishing calls to violence have been removed,"" said spokesperson Remi Vaughn in a message.

02-08-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,Inside the Telegram groups apparently used to plan unrest after Southport stabbings,"Fireworks and flares are now being advertised for sale on a Telegram messenger group that was used to call for a street presence in Southport in advance of this week's riot.Sky News has identified the individual responsible.Follow latest:Updates as police deal with protests and disorder'If this is the wrong channel join ours'The Telegram user joined a group on the messaging app on the morning of 30 July, sharing an AI-generated image of masked men standing in front of flaming emergency service vehicles.Prior to his joining, another user had shared a poster urging people to protest in Southport.When he joined, his second post was a call for people to share contacts that could help with transporting people to Southport.He told the group: ""More numbers we can get up there the better.""When another user expressed concern about ""vigilante stuff"", he responded by saying ""if this is the wrong channel join ours,"" while providing a link.Maps, fireworks and timings shared in groupThey continued posting in the first group, sharing a list of materials for sale including rockets, Roman candles and flares.They posted a series of pictures in the chat, which included fireworks bundled in their original packaging.Later posts concern plans for a street presence outside of Southport.In the other, newly created channel, a map of local mosques was posted alongside a photograph of a fire and details of a time to gather.Like in the first group, fireworks and flares were offered for sale, and a price list was shared.Clues link to previous channelA forwarded message from a Telegram channel that has the same username and profile picture as the account that posted in the first group was also sent.This channel has existed since February. While it recently pivoted to advertising fireworks and posting about Southport, older messages provide some further context.Describing itself as a promotional channel, before the unrest in Southport it mainly advertised cannabis and related items. It is unclear whether the channel was promoting drugs for sale directly or was advertising on behalf of third parties.The username of the account and promotional channel match an Instagram page that sells stickers, AI-generated graphic designs, and packaging. It links back to the Telegram channel in its bio.The Telegram and Instagram handle, which is highly distinctive, reveals Companies House filings for a packaging company of the same name.

02-08-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,How much of an Olympics medal boost do the host nations get - and at what cost?,"Hosts France are flying high in the medal table this year, having not finished in the top five overall since 1948.The teams above them in the top four are regular table-toppers China and the USA, and - after the latest flurry of medals - Team GB are not far behind.Previous hosts Japan sit a couple of places below Team GB at the time of writing, having finished third at the Tokyo games.In fact, five of the current top six have hosted the Olympics this century and the only ones that haven't (USA) are hosting next time.Part of that is to do with finances. Hosting the Olympics is expensive, and countries that can afford to host them also tend to be able to afford better facilities, coaching, equipment and otherwise support athletic development and elite performance.But how much of a boost is it having a home crowd behind you, and does it leave a legacy of success?It's pretty significant, according to the data.Looking at all of the hosts since 2000 - Australia, Greece, China, Great Britain, Brazil and Japan - countries won almost three times as many medals in their host year on average compared with their tally three Olympics before.Why it was so tough for GreeceGreece is the most extreme example. They won 16 medals in their host games in 2004, as many as they did in the six Olympics from 1976 to 1996 added together. In the four Games since then (not including the current one) they won 15.Dr Matthew Robinson, professor of sport management at the University of Delaware, leads an IOC-affiliated programme that funds sports development around the world, and has written a book chapter titled The Impact Of The Olympics On The High Performance Legacy Of A Host Country.He says Greece's sporting legacy post-Athens 2004 failed because they lacked some of the crucial economic factors typically required to host the Olympics.""Once the Games were over, [Greek] sport had nothing. They were actually harmed in hosting the Games, from a sporting perspective,"" he says.Dr Robinson said there have been criticisms of poor planning that led to the non-use of facilities after the Games, but also that the post-2008 economic crisis which engulfed Greece should be taken into consideration.A considerably smaller economy than the likes of China, the UK, France or Japan, Greece spent $11bn on hosting the Olympics in 2004, equivalent to almost 5% of its annual GDP. That's more than most countries allocate towards their militaries each year.China spent $42bn on the 2008 Olympics, but that equated to less than 1% of their annual economic production, five times less than Greece as a proportion.The UK - perhaps benefitting from existing sporting and transport infrastructure - spent a comparatively paltry $4bn on London 2012, 0.16% of GDP at the time.On that measure, the financial burden on Greece hosting the Olympics was 30 times greater than it was on Britain.Medal improvements before the host GamesMost other countries have sustained medal success after hosting, although mostly not quite at the same levels as when they had the home fans behind them.But interestingly, the data also shows that there tends to be gradual improvements in medals won at the Olympics prior to the hosting year, even if most countries eventually peak when they are hosting.Looking at the other countries that reached the final stage of the bidding process for the 2012 Olympics (awarded in 2005), medal success was fairly flat for France, Russia, Spain and the US.But for Team GB it rose by 70% from 2004 to 2008, and by another 43% from 2008 to 2012, meaning the tally was almost 2.5x higher overall in 2012 compared with 2004.""In the lead up to hosting, you'll see governments get behind sport in that country. Building out infrastructure, more facilities, more focus, more attention,"" Dr Robinson explains.""A lot of countries will put strategic plans into development or incentives for particular sports to excel in the lead up to the Games. And then you'll see there's a slight improvement in the Olympics before you host.""You put in almost eight years of investment in enhancing sports and you'll see results.""How Team GB and Brazil built success after hostingHosting itself also brings advantages, according to Dr Robinson.He says: ""When you host you factor in the home-field advantage, where athletes are not travelling, going to a different time-zone, and the psychological lift associated with being the home-team athlete.""Brazil and Team GB seem to have built on this investment best, improving upon medal-winning success even after their host years.Brazil won more at Tokyo in 2021 than they did in Rio in 2016, and Team GB have managed to sustain their medal success from 2012 to levels far above what we were used to.From 1948 to 2004 Team GB secured 21 medals per Olympics on average. Since 2012 they've averaged three times as many.Dr Robinson says the legacy effect of the UK Games on sport in Britain has been impressive.""People talk about the benefits of the Games, and it's always from an economic impact perspective - infrastructure has been built, there are cultural benefits too, in terms of tourism and investment etc.""London did an amazing Games. They had an incredible legacy plan in place that meant the facilities are still used. Athletes benefited from it before, during, and after the Games.""London is a model example of how the country has benefited from being a host, and sport being one of the things that has benefited, because I think often sport is discounted.""Dr Matthew Robinson wrote The Impact Of The Olympics On The High Performance Legacy Of A Host Country, a chapter in Handbook Of Sport And Legacy: Meeting The Challenge Of Major Sports Events, by R Holt and D Ruta.The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

31-07-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,Southport attack misinformation fuels far-right discourse on social media,"Information abhors a vacuum.So when the police and media, for legal reasons, put out only a few details about the Southport attacker - that he was 17 years old and born in Cardiff - misinformation rushed in instead.As far-right groups then began reposting the false claims and organising on messaging app Telegram, it made for a violent outcome.The misinformation started almost as soon as news of the knife attack on a Taylor Swift dance workshop for children broke on Monday, 29 July. Accounts on X, formerly Twitter, quickly began promoting false narratives about the attacker's nationality and religion.Anti-migrant sentiment goes viralOne account, European Invasion, which has more than 360,000 followers, said the suspect was ""a Muslim immigrant"" - a tweet that earned nearly four million impressions.Andrew Tate, the controversial influencer, follows that account, and amplified that false narrative, saying that the attacker was an ""illegal migrant"".The misinformation spread quickly, and social networks were quickly inundated with a tidal wave of similar content, almost immediately after the attack.And then a very specific piece of misinformation appeared: that the attacker was called ""Ali Al-Shakati"", and had arrived in the UK illegally on a boat last year. None of this is true, according to police statements and Sky News' investigation.Data from social media monitoring tool Talkwalker shows that on 29 July, there was a surge of engagements on posts that mention ""Southport"" and Islam-related terms, including ""Asylum"", ""Muslim"", ""Islam"", ""Islamic"" or ""Sharia"". Engagements on posts mentioning the fake name also ticked up.The name was initially posted on X in a now-deleted post. But it became popularised when an account called Channel 3 Now picked it up.Channel 3 Now appears to produce clickbait articles to drive advertising revenue. The only author listed on its site links to a Facebook page with four friends, one of which is a spam account, another posting exclusively about Channel 3 Now.Its social media pages have either been repurposed from previous names and branding or are relatively new and have few followers.Producers of spam content frequently repurpose, buy and sell accounts, and this alone is not evidence of a concerted effort to spread disinformation.After Channel 3 Now, larger outlets repeated the false name - including the Russian state-controlled news channel RT.The false name went viral - not as much as the general anti-Muslim sentiment, but this was a much more narrow claim. And it helped to solidify the narrative that an immigrant was to blame for the attack.""Enough is Enough""The febrile, anti-migrant and anti-Islam atmosphere collided with another separate, but related online movement.Posters calling for a protest to take place in Southport on Tuesday, 30 July began circulating widely.Merseyside Police specifically blamed the English Defence League (EDL), founded by Tommy Robinson, for causing trouble.They said: ""a large group of people - believed to be supporters of the English Defence League"" began throwing items at the police.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerOnline commentators - including Robinson - have said the EDL is defunct. Robinson said on X: ""The riots are by local residents fed up. Nothing to do with the EDL which closed down over a decade ago.""The EDL is largely defunct but the contemporary far right, which shares an ideology and includes many of the same individuals, still operates in clusters and networks under various banners.On Tuesday morning, ahead of the protests, one poster titled ""Enough is Enough"", bearing a handprint and a silhouette of figures holding hands, was shared by a known-far-right activist with links to Patriotic Alternative (PA). The group is a successor organisation to the British National Party (BNP). Members of PA were identifiable in footage taken at the eventual demonstration.The poster was then reposted on X, where posts are amplified by bigger accounts. This is not uncommon with material of this kind, which frequently originates in closed groups or fringe platforms such as Telegram, before being disseminated to mainstream audiences on larger sites.The most viral post disseminated this way contained a poster originating from a TikTok account with 144 followers. The user who reshared it has over 90,000 followers on X, and attracted over 485,000 views.This began to play into an even wider, more mainstream ecosystem.The chatter grew louder - specifically the question about what we are being told by authorities, who again, could not offer more detail due to legal reasons.A writer from the Spectator posted on X saying that a police officer told him what the public was being told was 'managed'.Tommy Robinson, the anti-Islam activist, cited that tweet approvingly, among the many posts he made about the murders and subsequent riot.Then an elected MP, Nigel Farage, posted this to X as well, in the evening of July 30, saying: ""I just wonder whether the truth is being withheld from us. I don't know the answer to that: I think it's a fair and legitimate question.""The police could not tell the public everything - it would risk collapsing any future trial, potentially meaning any accused could walk free - but the truth was not being withheld.But that is the background to the protests that quickly morphed into a riot in Southport in a matter of hours.In a statement posted to their website on Wednesday, 31 July, Channel 3 Now issued an apology.""I am writing to sincerely apologize for the misleading information published in a recent article on our website, Channel3 NOW. We deeply regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused"", wrote the editor in chief.But the damage had already been done.It is a complex interaction, of immediate online speculation; then specific misinformation, done for monetary or geopolitical gain; far-right networks organising on Telegram and other platforms; mainstream accounts encouraging people to believe the truth is being hidden.The result?

They did put a non-molestation court order in place, but he was breaching it,"" she explained, ""leaving notes at my door and going to my son's nursery daily.""When Louise phoned the police to report his breaches of the no-contact order, she felt that call handlers ""weren't taking it seriously"".It was his way of demonstrating to her that he was ""above the law"", because the police wouldn't intervene, she said.""I feel alone, vulnerable and scared now, because I've spoken out and gone against my ex-partner, but he's obviously gotten away with it.""It does not mean that evidence is not presentLouise's experience, where an investigation is closed despite the victim wishing to pursue action, is now shared by more than one in four domestic abuse victims, according to exclusive data collected by Sky News via Freedom of Information requests sent to all police forces in England and Wales.Our investigation found it is far more common for domestic abuse cases to end this way despite victim support for prosecution than in other types of crime - and it is rising.Such cases have increased from 23% of outcomes in 2019 to 27% in 2023, among the 29 forces that responded to the request.This is known as a Type 15 outcome, defined as when a crime is confirmed and the victim supports police action, but evidential difficulties prevent further action.It includes cases where the suspect has been circulated as wanted but cannot be traced.It is more likely that there will be a named suspect in domestic abuse flagged offences, because for the domestic nature of the crime to be recognised the relationship between suspect and victim must have already been established.In response to these findings, Amy Bowdrey, policy and public affairs officer at domestic abuse support charity Refuge, told Sky News: ""It speaks to what we as an organisation hear from survivors all the time.""Often at Refuge, we will encourage survivors to keep a paper trail of evidence. To know that in a large proportion of those cases that evidence is there, but the police just aren't taking it seriously, is really, really concerning for us.""Detective Inspector Adam Gascoigne, from Derbyshire Constabulary's high risk domestic abuse unit, said: ""The threshold that needs to be met to get cases to court is extremely high and there must be a realistic prospect of conviction for the matter to proceed.""Unfortunately, in some cases the evidence simply isn't there to secure that, so the difficult decision has to be made that a matter is closed outcome 15, which means it does not proceed to court.""This decision can either be made by the police force investigating or the Crown Prosecution Service.""This does not mean that evidence is not present, but that the standard of evidence available does not necessarily meet the very high threshold needed to proceed to court in the hopes of securing a conviction.""Complex casesTwenty-two police forces provided more detailed breakdowns of domestic abuse investigation outcomes by type of offence.Their responses show that outcomes are worse in specific types of crime, particularly in more complex cases involving coercive control.Coercive control is a continuous pattern of behaviour intended to exert power or control over a victim and was made a criminal offence in 2015 in England and Wales. This can include a range of behaviours including psychological, emotional, and financial abuse.Offences classified as stalking and harassment, under which coercive control is included, resulted in Type 15 outcomes in more than a third of cases (34%) in 2023, up from 30% in 2019.Dr Charlotte Barlow, reader in criminal justice and policing at the University of Central Lancashire, researches criminal justice and police responses to domestic abuse.She says that there have been some improvements in police responses to domestic abuse since the coercive control legislation has come into force, in particular officers recognising the need to ""dig deeper"" in domestic abuse cases to see what is going on.""But there are still persistent issues with the frontline response, in particular responding to 'incidents' of abuse rather than a pattern of abusive behaviour occurring over time. This means that real moments of evidence gathering opportunities are missed,"" she told Sky News.Domestic abuse is an extremely prevalent crime, and the police record nearly 3,000 calls relating to violence against women and girls each day, according to a recent report by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) and the College of Policing.Sixteen per cent of all crimes, and one-third of violent crimes, investigated between 2019 and 2023 by police in the data collected by Sky News were flagged as domestic abuse.The first police response is often a pivotal moment for evidence gathering, and an opportunity to gather vital information from the victim and other sources.Incidents with clear physical evidence of violence, for example, present more straightforward investigative opportunities for responding officers.In violence with injury investigations, Type 15 outcomes were recorded in 24% of cases, compared to 33% for stalking and harassment, in 2023.""One of the issues that I found in my work on police responses to coercive control in particular is it might be a number of days after the victim-survivor called before the police visit, when there might not be any physical evidence there anymore, if it was there in the first place,"" Dr Barlow said.""Sometimes the police can then perceive, 'oh, it's just one word against the other'. But there are other forms of evidence that could be gathered as well as physical evidence. For example, victim-survivor testimony, speaking to other friends and family, evidence on phones, or evidence of economic abuse through bank statements.""""It is more challenging to evidence coercive control,"" she acknowledged, ""but there are evidence gathering opportunities that are not always utilised, which can be because of time pressures and resource constraints.""Increase in recorded offencesWest Yorkshire Police, the fourth largest police force in England, told Sky News that they have consistently recorded a higher rate of domestic offences than other police forces in recent years, but that both this, as well as the rise in cases where victims support prosecution, can be viewed as a positive development.The force said: ""This can in part be attributed to the force's ethical and victim-focused crime recording practices, which have been praised by the HMICFRS [police inspectorate], and a growing confidence of victims to report domestic abuse generally. While the number of overall charges for domestic abuse offences did fall following the COVID pandemic it has been increasing in the last two years.""This is not the case for all police forces, however. Overall, in the data we assessed, the charge rate for domestic abuse investigations fell from 10% to 8%.The total number of crimes recorded by police has increased in recent years, as has the overall number of crimes charged.The number of investigations completed in 2023 was 15% higher than in 2019, (after an initial drop during COVID), for non-domestic abuse-related cases, and while the number of charges didn't match this pace of increase, they did rise by 8%.The number of domestic abuse investigations rose faster and was 23% higher than in 2019. In contrast, however, the number of charges brought in 2023 is slightly lower than the number in 2019, at 43,846, compared to 43,889 (among responding forces).Ms Bowdrey said that this is in part because ""we're speaking about domestic abuse more, and more people are reporting it.""But it's not being matched to an understanding, which I think is leading to these cases not being progressed.""That's not just within policing, that's also within the CPS as well. There's a lack of joint working between the CPS and the police to make sure that case files are really strong. We're just not seeing that.""Both the CPS and the NPCC acknowledge that working practices between police and prosecutors should be improved to increase justice for victims, which is part of the aim of the national Domestic Abuse Joint Justice Plan which is under development.Staffing and backlogsThese issues can also be understood through the lens of workforce pressures as well as backlogs further along in the criminal justice system.Recent additions to the police workforce, which has grown by 36,000 for all full-time employees (including staff) since 2019, have nearly restored employee numbers to the level they were before austerity cuts through the 2010s.But the increase in reported crime has outpaced the growth in workforce.As a result, the number of crimes recorded per employee in 2024 has increased by nearly 60% since 2010, from 18 to 28 crimes recorded per full-time employee in the police.Meanwhile, the courts are still suffering from huge caseload backlogs, which were already significant in 2019 but rose rapidly over the pandemic and currently remain on an upward trajectory.This can also contribute to poor outcomes at court, where 24% of domestic abuse cases fail at trial (compared to 17% of all cases).Many factors contribute to this, including victim attrition (where victims pull out of supporting the prosecution), which can be exacerbated by long waits for trial.Police responseNational Police Chiefs' Council Lead for Domestic Abuse, Assistant Commissioner Louisa Rolfe, said: ""Tackling domestic abuse is a priority for policing and we are committed to protecting victims, bringing perpetrators to justice and preventing these horrific crimes.""We have made vast improvements in the way that we respond to domestic abuse... But, we know that there is more to do to support victims and bring more perpetrators to justice.""We are working closely with the Crown Prosecution Service to improve the successful investigation and prosecution of domestic abuse cases under the Domestic Abuse Joint Justice Plan.""We want to ensure everyone feels confident reporting to the police and will do everything we can to provide victims with the right support, safeguarding and to secure justice wherever possible.""CPS responseA Crown Prosecution Service spokesperson said: ""We are also transforming the service we provide to victims through our long-term Victim Transformation Programme, which aims to improve victim experiences and help to support prosecutions.""When a case is referred to us for a charging decision, data shows most will result in a prosecution and conviction - but we recognise the overall number of prosecutions is still too low and we are striving to improve this.""*Louise's name has been changed to protect her identity.If you or someone you know is a victim of domestic abuse, support is available.MethodologyWe sent Freedom of Information requests to the 43 police forces in England and Wales to request recorded crime data from 2015 to 2019 by date of investigation closure, outcome, whether the offence was classified as domestic abuse, and the underlying type of offence.29 police forces responded to the request with data from at least 2019 onwards, so this has been used as the starting date for comparison. 22 forces provided the requested crime classification breakdown.Non-crime incidents, fraud offences, and other non-countable offences have been excluded in accordance with Home Office Counting Rules.The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

25-07-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,Betting data shows Harris's chances are on the up but Trump is still leading ,"As Joe Biden withdraws from the 2024 US presidential race and Kamala Harris gains support from prominent Democrats, data from Betfair Exchange indicates that her odds are improving.The vice president still faces a significant challenge to surpass Donald Trump, however, who has maintained strong performance over nearly the past year.A day before Mr Biden dropped out of the presidential race, he was 57 percentage points behind Mr Trump according to betting odds data from Betfair.Mr Trump's chances of winning were 64%, with Mr Biden on 7% and Ms Harris on 17%.At the start of the 2024 Republican National Convention, just days after Mr Trump's assassination attempt, his chances stood at 69%.After Mr Biden dropped out of the race on Sunday, Mr Trump's chances of winning had fallen to 62%.As Mr Biden endorsed Ms Harris on Sunday, her chances rose by six percentage points to 23% and as more endorsements come in from top Democrats today her chances have gone up to 29%, the highest recorded for the current vice president but still 33 percentage points behind Mr Trump.Interestingly, Ms Harris's chances of winning were higher than both Mr Biden and Mr Trump in 2021.Mr Biden's numerous gaffes, from introducing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as Vladimir Putin, to rambling and mumbling at the first debate of the presidential season, has meant Mr Trump has enjoyed a particularly high lead over the current US president over the past month.From the beginning of July 2024, Mr Trump's lead over Mr Biden according to the bookies has consistently been 40 percentage points or more. From 5 July it's been at least 50 percentage points.Mr Trump has consistently been ahead of Mr Biden since around the time of the current president's impeachment inquiry in September 2023, with the exception of three days in April 2024 where Mr Biden's chances were less than a percentage point more than Mr Trump.That period covers the time leading up to Mr Trump's criminal trial, although on 30 May when he was eventually found guilty, he had a lead over Mr Biden of two percentage points.Mr Biden's highest lead over Mr Trump was on 7 June 2023, when he was 18 percentage points ahead.Several of Mr Biden's top leads over Mr Trump occurred in June 2023, around the time indictments were filed against Mr Trump.One was submitted on 30 March, another on 8 June, which was dismissed and two more in August which have yet to be decided.He was found guilty on all counts of falsifying business records related to the indictment filed on 30 March.However, this did not significantly dent his lead, likely due to growing concerns about Mr Biden's fitness to remain in office, which ultimately led to his withdrawal from the race.The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

19-07-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,From banking to flights and supermarkets: Charts show when IT outages peaked across services,"Outages have been reported today across airlines, supermarkets, banking and communication services as well as the NHS and trains.CrowdStrike, which provides cyber attack monitoring and protection to many major businesses, said the problem was caused by a ""defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts"", adding it was not a security incident or cyber attack.Latest on worldwide IT outageSky News has been tracking issues like flight delays and cancellations, reports of service outages and Google searches to see when people first started noticing problems.AirlinesThe first signs of trouble in the UK were from users of airline services across Ryanair, British Airways and WizzAir.Air travellers are often up early to get to the airport and problems with checking in can cause additional stress and panic. Reports first started at around 7am before peaking at around 8.30am.As of the late afternoon, users were still reporting issues but not in the same numbers as the early morning.Ryanair has had the highest number of outage reports according to Downdetector, a website which records issues people have raised with IT services and connectivity.At around 10.30am, more than nine in 10 flights from some major UK airports were either delayed or cancelled, and that carried on through to the afternoon.A quarter of total flights out of Edinburgh on Friday have been cancelled, as of 5pm, and more than nine in 10 flights out of Heathrow, the UK's busiest airport, have been either cancelled or delayed.The average delay at Heathrow has been almost an hour, and almost an hour and a half at Edinburgh.Passengers at airports across Europe have been affected too, with Amsterdam, Barcelona, Madrid, Rome, Stuttgart and Naples all reporting major disruptions.About half of the Ryanair issues were related to check-in, with the remainder split between website and app problems.More than three-quarters of British Airways outage reports were connected to check-in, while more people were having issues with the Wizz Air app.BankingReports about banking services, like Visa and Mastercard, and individual banks such as Nationwide and Lloyds, also started coming in early. They started around 7am but peaked a bit later at 8am.Like the airlines, they have carried on to cause disruption throughout the day, although at lower levels than the morning as users have either adapted their behaviour or fixed the issue.Visa appears to have been worst affected, with issues evenly split between purchases and payments.Nationwide has also seen issues related to online banking specifically, with two-thirds of reports citing this issue.SupermarketsThe first issues from supermarkets started coming in at around 9am, peaking at about 10am.There have been fewer reports from the likes of Waitrose and Lidl compared with Tesco and Sainsbury's, but that doesn't mean they've been less badly affected.It could just be a reflection of the fact that more people are trying to interact with services at Britain's two biggest supermarkets.Most of the reports - about three quarters in total across all supermarkets - were related to checkout, with website issues and order tracking responsible for the remainder.There have been fewer reports so far about any issues relating to supermarket app services, but again this could be a reflection of which services people use most often rather than them being immune from issues.Tom Cheshire, data and forensics correspondentThe CEO of Crowdstrike called it  a defect    some understatement there -   in a single content update . And a Sky News engineer told me that the piece of code that caused such chaos all over the world was just 41 kilobytes big - for context, the average file size of a song is 3mb, or 3000 kilobytes.To wreak such havoc tells us much about how our societies and economies are built. The internet was originally designed as a decentralised network with no single, central point of failure   if one part goes down, you could reroute traffic. That essential architecture still holds. But two things have shifted and make incidents like today s more likely and more damaging.First, and by definition, we have never relied on the internet as much as we do now   it s wired into everything that makes society run.Second, a few giant tech firms have come to dominate. So a small update from Crowdstrike, because of its interaction with Windows platforms, can have cascading effects.Crowdstrike s CEO said that his company continued to  protect [customers] and keep the bad guys out their systems.  Customers may wish they had kept the good guys out instead.CommunicationsMicrosoft Teams and Microsoft 365 have been particularly badly affected - there was a rush of reports at 8am as people tried to log in to check emails or messages.Error reports slowed throughout the day as many Teams users neared the end of their working week.There also appeared to have been a smaller rise in reported issues with other communications channels including WhatsApp and O2.Most problems reported with WhatsApp related to sending messages, and 70% of issues reported with O2 were related to lack of signal, with a further 16% to do with mobile internet.The majority of problem reports for Microsoft 365 were related to issues with server connection, while 22% were to do with login issues and 20% related to OneDrive.The way many people first noticed issues with their Microsoft products was by seeing a ""blue screen of death"" on their computer monitors.Google searches for the term ""blue screen"" have reached their highest level in five years today.Searches worldwide peaked at 7.15am UK time, with people in Australia, China, India and North America all looking up the term.Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia are the three territories with the most relative search interest in the past 24 hours, but that may be because they were more likely to have been awake when the problems first started.Alive map provided by the internet monitoring company Thousand Eyes showed that applications and networks have reported outages on all continents.The map shows a particularly high number of reported outages in Europe, the United States and Australia.We will update this story later on to see which services have recovered and which are having lasting problems.The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

16-07-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,Trump shooting: How the security operation unfolded ,"Within minutes, what should have been a regular rally for Donald Trump quickly spiraled into a deadly assassination attempt in Pennsylvania.Using videos from the ground and aerial imagery, Sky News details what we know about the security efforts before and during the attack.Our analysis found police vehicles were parked as close as 20m/65ft away from the gunman and members of the crowd had spotted the shooter on the roof of a building two minutes before shots were fired at the former president.As questions remain for the Secret Service, former senior executive from FBI counterterrorism Christopher O'Leary said they were presented with a ""challenging mission"" but were ""ultimately responsible"" for protecting Trump and the crowd.Sniper teams in position before event startsTrump's campaign rally took place on Saturday evening at the Butler Farm Show, around 50km/30 miles north of Pittsburgh.Footage filmed of the crowds an hour before he began his speech, shows two security teams walking on the roofs of two warehouses behind the stage.Trump begins speechAt 6.05pm local time Trump began his speech on stage to crowd chants of ""USA"".As Trump speaks, the two security teams are seen on top of the warehouses. Security experts have told Sky News that it's highly likely more than two sniper units were present.In a video taken by a member of the crowd, one security member is seen looking through binoculars facing west (labelled two in the map above).Neither of the two officers seen in footage appear to be holding guns, with one facing away from the rally and the other towards the former president - but not in the direct direction of the gunman.One security expert said there would have been several countersniper teams at the event and not all of them would be holding firearms at all times.Read more:Biden addresses the nation after Trump attackTrump says 'I'm supposed to be dead' after assassination attemptDetails of 'bullied Trump' gunman revealedTim McMillan, who worked on several presidential and vice-presidential security details and is a retired law enforcement professional said for countersniper teams ""it isn't just all about having your gun at the ready, it also relates to scouting external threats, really far out perimeter threats"".In another video filmed from the crowd, as Trump continues to talk, the other security team on the roof of the other warehouse can be seen (labelled one in the map above).Both are armed with weapons pointing north in the general direction of where the gunman is positioned.Sky News analysis of the area suggests a large tree blocked the view between the gunman and this unit. This means only the pair of snipers furthest from the attacker had a clear view of him.However, in the days before the event, the rooftop from which the gunman fired was identified by the Secret Service as a potential vulnerability, two sources familiar with the agency's operations have told NBC News.Another video filmed at the rally moments before the attack shows three police cars next to the building on to which the gunman had climbed - with the closest we found just 20m/65ft away.Crowd spot gunman on roofAround four minutes into his speech, a crowd member spots the gunman on the roof of the building.""Yeah, someone is on top of the roof"", a man is heard saying as he pans to the gunman - later identified by the FBI as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks. He is seen holding a rifle.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerBy cross-referencing a live stream of Trump's full speech and matching the audio with the video taken by the crowd member - we found that the man who took the video appeared to have spotted the gunman four minutes after Trump began speaking.Other crowd members may have spotted the gunman before this video was taken.Unaware of the gunman, Trump turned to the topic of immigration.Local officer reportedly saw gunmanThe Associated Press (AP) reports that several crowd members had told local officers Crooks was acting suspiciously and pacing near metal detectors, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Officers were then told Crooks was climbing a ladder, the official said, adding that officers searched for him but were unable to find him before he made it on to the roof.Butler County Sheriff Michael Slupe told AP that a local officer did climb up to the roof and encountered Crooks, who saw the officer and turned towards him, forcing the officer to drop down to safety.Mr Slupe said the officer couldn't have wielded his own gun under the circumstances. The officer retreated down the ladder and soon afterwards Crooks began shooting, according to two officials who spoke to AP anonymously.Shots fired at TrumpIn the seconds before the first shots are fired, both sniper units seem to get into position. The gunman then fires three initial gunshots, another five follow in quick succession three seconds later.As the first shot rings out, Trump raises his hand to his right ear and looks at it, before quickly crouching to the ground.Audio analysis by Sky News indicates that there is a six-second gap between the gunman's first shot and the first shot taken by the Secret Service.One final shot by a law enforcement sniper is heard 10 seconds later.Secret Service agents rush to the stage and pile on top the former president to shield him as the gunman is shot dead by the snipers.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerSky News analysis found that the gunman began shooting two minutes after he was spotted by the man filming the videos we analysed.Shortly after Trump, having been hit in the ear, gets to his feet and lifts his right fist before he is scrambled into a vehicle and taken to hospital.Why was gunman within 150 yards with rifle?A security expert told Sky News the US Secret Service is ""ultimately responsible"" adding that the gunman should not have been able to get within 150 yards (137 m) of the former president.Former senior executive from FBI counterterrorism and senior vice president for global operations for the Soufan Group, Christopher O'Leary, said: ""The Secret Service was responsible for protecting former President Trump and the crowd that was there as well. They have concentric circles of protection that go out and theirs ended at the fence line.""But they have state and local law enforcement that were responsible for those other perimeters. They should have had other Secret Service personnel coding, coordinating that out there and clearly they didn't.  Click to subscribe to the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcasts  ""The real question is, why was this individual within 150 yards with a high-powered rifle?""Mr O'Leary added that the Secret Service were presented with a ""really challenging mission"" due to factors including the ""open-air space"" venue chosen by Trump and his campaign, which makes it more difficult to protect.Additional reporting by Megan Baynes, digital investigations reporter and Michelle Inez Simon, visual investigations producer.",https://news.sky.com/story/trump-shooting-how-the-security-operation-unfolded-13178285
16-07-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,Gareth Southgate's record compared to other England managers,"After more than 100 games, Gareth Southgate's tenure in the most high-pressured job in world football is over.His cultural legacy already includes a West End play (soon to be turned into a TV series), an Atomic Kitten remix, and the healing of a nation's collective trauma around penalty shootouts.His footballing legacy is littered with moments that England fans will remember forever.Kieran Trippier's free-kick, Luke Shaw's volley, Eric Dier's penalty, Trent Alexander-Arnold's penalty, Jordan Pickford's saves! That Jude Bellingham overhead kick, that Ollie Watkins winner and the Cole Palmer strike last week that allowed us to believe for a few minutes more.Read more:Southgate resigns as England managerWho could replace Southgate?England's nearly man was still a successDespite some of the best tournament results in years, Southgate - like all those in the role before him - has been subject to near-constant fan criticism for his style of play being too negative and failing to get the most out of talented individuals.Was the criticism fair? Let's take a look at the data.It's all about winningOnly four England men's managers - Fabio Capello, Sir Alf Ramsey, Glen Hoddle and Ron Greenwood - have won a higher percentage of their England games than Southgate.It's all about winning when it mattersWhen we look at wins at major tournaments - World Cups and Euros - Southgate's record is more impressive.Only Sir Alf Ramsey, who famously led England to World Cup glory in 1966, has a better record.Capello's near flawless record in qualifying was shown up at the 2010 World Cup, his only tournament in charge, so he drops from top of the overall list to second bottom.What about the goals?It might be a surprise to see that Southgate's England scored more per game on average than under all but two previous England managers.Combining that with solid defences means the difference between goals scored and conceded per game is better than any individual manager.Only the England Selection Committee that picked sides prior to 1939 have a better overall record in terms of goal difference.Southgate's forwards also delivered when it mattered too. Only Glen Hoddle's 1998 side scored more per game than Southgate's teams have over the course of four tournaments.Only Terry Venables's 1996 side had a better average goal difference at major tournaments.Tournament legacyGoals and wins are nice but they only really matter if they lead to success.Although Southgate ultimately failed to go all the way, no one can deny that he has made England genuinely competitive again at tournaments.Inheriting a recent history of an embarrassing World Cup group-stage exit and a Euros loss to Iceland under Roy Hodgson, Southgate's record ends with two Euros runners-up medals, a World Cup semi-final and a quarter-final.England's men's teams have never sustained a series of finishes at tournaments like that in their history.Southgate's average finishing position - between third and fourth place - is bettered only by Venables whose 1996 team finished third in his only tournament in charge.With Nations League fixtures as early as September and World Cup qualifying early next year, whoever steps into Southgate's waistcoat/knitwear will need to act quickly to unite the team after a painful end to the Euros.If by the end of their tenure they end up bettering his record, there's a strong chance they will go down as England's best ever.The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

16-07-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,Record levels of diversity in parliament - not by chance but because of purposeful effort,"More than half of this new parliament is made up of new MPs which makes the House of Commons a better reflection of the nation it serves.Having more than 50% of MPs entering the Commons for the first time does have benefits but also poses some issues.""This is significant because, on the one hand, we will have very fresh faces that will be starting their careers, but also will come with new positions on key issues,"" said Dr Sof a Collignon, senior lecturer in comparative politics at Queen Mary University of London.""For a record number of people there will be required training, they will be required to get experience with parliamentary procedures, but also with the spoken and unspoken norms of working in parliament. The unspoken norms are something that you learn by working there, you learn by experience,"" added Dr Collignon.The levels of diversity across different demographics are not a sudden change but the product of a purposeful effort over many years to encourage and promote people of minorities to become parliamentarians.""One thing that is key is that we are seeing the results of all the Labour Party efforts to recruit women and diverse candidates,"" said Dr Collignon.In his first Commons speech as prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the ""most diverse parliament by race and gender"", this week.Women now make up more than two-fifths of the House of Commons and while that isn't fully representative of the British population, it's 10 percentage points higher than the level in the 2015 election and immensely higher than 0.7% female MPs 100 years ago.At 14%, which is 90 MPs in the Commons, the proportion of MPs from ethnically diverse backgrounds much better represents the ethnically diverse population in Britain at 17%.This is nearly 23 times higher than the four MPs who were elected in 1987, including Dianne Abbott, the first black female MP.This is also one of the most diverse parliaments in terms of sexuality and gender identity.Sixty-four MPs openly identify as LGBTQ+. This is the highest level at the start of a parliament but the number has been higher and lower at other points such as when Rishi Sunak called the election when the number was 68.One of these MPs is the Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer, who describes herself as bisexual or pansexual. She's also part of a group of at least six Quakers who have been elected at this parliament.Educational backgrounds are also changing. The number of politicians who have had a private education has been decreasing.In Sir Keir's new cabinet, out of 25 cabinet members, just one went to private school and one to grammar school - Louise Haigh and the prime minister himself.Labour have generally had a lower share of MPs who have been privately educated.A total of 23 (92%) were state educated, that's a huge leap up from 19% in the cabinets of Mr Sunak and Liz Truss.Political correspondentThis isn't just Britain's most diverse parliament, it also more closely reflects society than ever before. There will be more women, gay people and ethnic minorities sitting in the House of Commons when the King opens parliament. Crucially, many more will have been educated at state schools - that goes for the front bench too.Sir Keir Starmer has already celebrated the ""most diverse parliament in history"" and generally this is a good thing - when democratic institutions look like the people they represent it fosters trust in those institutions.However, that trust is not unconditional and it is not a given that the public will get policies that better serve their interests.For example, the Tories track record on female representation hasn't translated into support from female voters. As former prime minister David Cameron pushed for more female representation in the Conservative Party, staring down local associations in the process. The number of Women MPs increased during the Tory years, yet support for the Conservatives among women has shrunk over the past decade. Women were once more likely to vote Conservative than men, now women are far more likely to vote Labour.Nor, can we assume that MPs' politics are informed by the blunt characteristics of their identity, or predict the ways in which they have been informed by those characteristics. For example, in recent years, the country has had three home secretaries from South Asian backgrounds and a British Indian prime minister, as well as a black chancellor and a black business secretary. All of them promoted the Conservative government's tough anti-immigration stance.So, while the new prime minister might celebrate the diversity on display, the consequences could be difficult to predict.Currently the proportion of privately educated Conservative MPs stands at 46%, that's eight percentage points lower than when David Cameron got elected and 16 percentage points lower than when John Major's government was elected in 1992.While the percentage of privately educated MPs in major parties has been decreasing, the overall proportion remains significantly higher than that of the current UK school population. Currently, 23% of MPs were privately educated, compared with 7% of today's students.Overall, the new composition of the House of Commons is younger on average and significantly more diverse, which could have a positive impact for everyone.""In general, the pool of candidates is becoming a bit younger. On average the youngest were from the Labour Party, because they won the majority of the seats, so this is going to be a young parliament,"" said Dr Collignon.""We want the best policies that are possible and we can only get them if we hear from and if we have evidence from people from different backgrounds, with different experiences. That can only come if we have a parliament that is better represented, so we can achieve better substantive representation of key issues,"" she added.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsBe the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeThe Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

10-07-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,"Euro 2024 semi-final: How bad are England playing really, and does it matter when it comes to winning?","England take on The Netherlands at the Euros this evening, with a final against Spain on Sunday up for grabs.The endings of the last two England games have certainly been memorable, but all the other bits have been far from it.After five perfect penalties and a last-minute overhead kick, England are in the semi finals, but critics will tell you they don't deserve to be there. However, history and data shows us that a defensive strategy can pay off.What's been disappointing for many fans is seeing the likes of Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden and Harry Kane, best players or top scorers in Spain, England and Germany respectively, struggle to replicate their club form on the international stage.If that's what you think's been happening, your eyes haven't been deceiving you - the stats back it up. But perhaps it's the old England fan favourite of hyped up expectations that's leaving them feeling disappointed again.Jude Bellingham has actually been England's best player so far, according to the data - he's averaged a 'WhoScored' rating of 7.27 out of 10 in his five matches so far.WhoScored is a football analytics company that measures player performance using an algorithm that weights over 200 different statistics - from dribbles to passes to tackles to goals, based on their positive or negative influence on the game.Politics latest: Labour to take action against MPs who defied Starmer on winter fuel voteGareth Southgate says he has no regrets after quitting as England managerOliver Campbell: Brain-damaged man who was jailed for life over murder has conviction quashedDespite apparently being England's finest, these Euros performances from Bellingham are still not up to the level we've been used to seeing from him this season.The Birmingham-born midfielder averaged 7.81 out of 10 for Real Madrid, the second-best average in men's elite football last season.The only man to score higher for their club was England captain Harry Kane. He averaged 7.82 out of 10 for Bayern Munich, but has fallen to just 6.78 in the Euros so far, despite his two goals in five games.That's one of the biggest differences between club and Euros form, but the overall score still leaves him as the country's fifth highest ranked player this tournament, just ahead of defensive duo Marc Guehi and John Stones.The centre backs are the only players so far who have managed to outperform their club form for their country.What has that meant as a team?There's no other way to put it, England's attack has been terrible.If you look at 'expected goals' or 'xG', a measure of the quality of attacking chances based on how many similar shots in the past have been scored, only Scotland have created less per game.Football stats companies like Opta now record expected goals alongside traditional stats like shots on target or possession.Spain, who England will face in the final should they beat The Netherlands, have created more xG than anyone bar Croatia.Attack isn't everything, however. Croatia, you may remember, were eliminated at the group stage, along with Czechia (fourth in the creative chances metrics). Austria (third) went out in the first knockout round.The case for the defenceWhile England's attack has been poor, it has one of the tightest defences, third only to fellow semi-finalists France and hosts Germany in terms of the fewest amount of high-quality chances they've allowed goalkeeper Jordan Pickford to face.All of the tournament's four semi-finalists are in the top seven best performing defences, perhaps vindicating Gareth Southgate's suggestions that it may a better indicator for success at tournament level than attacking prowess.What does it mean in terms of winning?You probably remember where you were when you watched England face Italy in the Euro 2020 final at Wembley.What you might not remember is that you were watching a clash between that tournament's two tightest defences, but just the sixth and ninth best attacks.Spain were best going forward again that year, while the likes of Poland and even Scotland, both eliminated at the group stage again, had better attacks than England who were a couple of penalties away from winning the whole thing.In 2016, expected goals as a concept had not yet become mainstream enough for it to be recorded by Opta.But winners Portugal conceded just one goal in the knockouts. They also only won one match in normal time in the whole tournament, against Wales, suggesting that other parts of their performances might have been lacking like England's have.Spain didn't concede in the knockouts at all when they won in 2008 and did even better when they defended the title in 2012, conceding just one goal in the whole tournament.Greece also one-niled themselves the whole way through the knockouts for their incredible surprise victory in 2004.As Michael Owen once famously said, if teams don't score, they hardly ever win. But the last 20 years of history shows us that if teams don't concede, they have a really good chance of winning the Euros.The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

05-07-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,Labour's landslide election in maps and charts,"The general election delivered a dramatic shift across the country.The Conservative vote has fallen by around 20 points, having lost out to Labour almost everywhere across the nation.That was enough for Labour to gain more than 200 seats. But it wasn't all positives. They lost in big cities to the Greens and independents and only increased their vote share overall by 1.6 points.That translated to four Green seats, their highest ever total. The Lib Dems made more than 60 gains, taking the party past recent high-points of the mid-2000s under the stewardship of Charles Kennedy and later Nick Clegg.Bashing incumbentsThis was an election where voters seem to have delivered a damning verdict on the performance of incumbents.In Scotland, the SNP vote was down 15 points, with Labour up 17. In Wales, while Labour picked up nine seats, its vote was down - 41 points to 37.Sinn Fein also became the largest party in Northern Ireland after the DUP lost three seats and eight percentage points.Fighting on two frontsThe Conservatives have collapsed in the face of a challenge on their right, from the Reform Party, while Labour and the Liberal Democrats have taken advantage of the willingness of voters to their left - seeing the government caught in a pincer movement.Conservatives losing most in their strongest areasThe fall in the Conservative vote was greatest where it started highest.In seats where the party started above 60%, it lost around 30%, in seats where it started on less than 20% it lost less than 8%.In contrast, Labour saw the largest rises in its vote in places where it won between 20% and 30% of the vote in 2019 - leaving it well-positioned to take advantage of the collapse in the Conservative vote.The importance of BrexitIt was the Reform Party that hammered the nail into the coffin of the Conservative Party.It secured an increase of 12.5 points in its national vote. This was over six points higher in seats that the Brexit Party had not stood in in 2019.After a number of years in which Brexit shaped the fortunes of the Conservatives (and Labour), the Leave vote in 2016 is now far more strongly correlated with support for Reform rather than the Conservatives.Tactical votingAmidst this surge of disillusionment with the incumbent, there is evidence that voters responded to the options on offer to them.The Lib Dems were up nearly nine points in seats where they started in second place behind the Conservatives, while Labour's vote was flat.In contrast, in seats where Labour started behind the government in second place, their vote was up nearly six points.Another important story of the night was the large falls in the Labour vote in areas with large Muslim communities. The party's vote fell by nearly 20 points in areas with a population of more than 30% Muslims.Starmer's popularityWhile Sir Keir Starmer will start his premiership with the strongest majority since Tony Blair, and against an even more wounded opposition, the election result was not neccesarily a ringing endorsement of his popularity.The party ended with just over a third of the national vote, and received fewer total votes than under Blair in 1997 - when the population of the country was much smaller - or even Jeremy Corbyn in 2019.The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

05-07-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,Historic firsts from the 2024 general election in numbers and charts,"How will this election be remembered?Labour have seized power from the Conservatives after 14 years in opposition, with a landslide majority.This is a rare occasion - the last time that two consecutive elections resulted in different parties forming working majorities was in 1992-1997.Also, 1997 - the year that Tony Blair won his first landslide Labour victory - was the last time that a government won anything close to the majority Sir Keir Starmer is about to achieve.At the time of publication, there had been more than 400 confirmed Labour victories.Whether he overtakes Blair's post-war record of 179 remains in the balance.The Conservatives have suffered their worst ever defeat in a century, winning fewer than the 156 seats they achieved in 1906.Who is favourite to win the US election?

Instead, the country's votes have been split across a range of political parties.The Lib Dems are currently on 71 seats, higher than even in their 2005 heyday peak of 62 seats. Effective tactical campaigning may have played a part.Based on current results, the combined vote share for Conservatives and Labour is 57.7%, another lowest on record.

Find out hereMeet Victoria, Sir Keir Starmer's wifeWho won the popular vote?Reform's vote share is up from 2% in 2019 (albeit when many candidates weren't put forward) to over 14% now.This has landed them four seats, and will be their first time represented in the House of Commons.The Greens have also won an unprecedented 4 seats, having only had one previously, and are up four points on national vote share to 7%.As a result, both parties have come second place in a record number of constituencies.WipeoutsLabour is now the largest party in Scotland, clawing its way back after a decade of SNP dominance. It continues the trend that Labour have never won a general election without winning Scotland.There's only one Conservative seat remaining in the North East of England, down from eight in 2019. The region was symbolic of their victory under Johnson and is now once again a sea of red.The Conservatives have lost all of their seats in Wales, and have no MPs in Oxfordshire where Lord Cameron used to represent. They've also been wiped out in Cornwall.Ousted MPs and new facesLiz Truss is only the second former Prime Minister to lose their seat at a general election. Her vote share was down more than 43 points and Labour were up just 8.4 points, their candidate winning the seat on the low vote share of just 26.7%.There have been 12 former MPs that attended cabinet just weeks ago when Rishi Sunak called the surprise election who have been kicked out by their electorates. This is the most cabinet members to lose their seats ever.Key names include Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former Brexit minister, and Penny Mourdant the once hopeful Tory leader, who both lost to Labour. Gillian Keegan, who was education secretary, was ousted by the Liberal Democrats.Labour themselves have lost a potential cabinet member; Green co-leader Carla Denyer beat Thangnam Debbonaire in Bristol Central.But with 400 MPs to choose from, Sir Keir Starmer shouldn't have trouble forming a cabinet of his own.There are many new MPs who will sit in Parliament for the first time next week, including the first MP to be born in this millennium, Hertford & Stortford's Josh Dean.

This morning the country is waking up to their second biggest ever victory.So far there have been 301 seats gained. More than 80% have been Tory losses. A further 39 were SNP defences, another party that have had a terrible night.The Lib Dems have had their best ever performance though, winning 70 seats - eight more than their previous 2005 record.Reform UK have won four seats on a national vote share two points higher than Sir Ed Davey's party.

Kik does not allow users to view messages sent before joining.We found Plumb created his Kik account in November 2022 - 11 months before he was arrested. His picture is a photo of Holly Willoughby in pyjamas - taken from the celebrity's lifestyle brand Instagram account, Wylde Moon.At the time of publishing, Plumb's account is still searchable and has not been taken down by the platform. Sky News has approached Kik for comment.Days after we joined, the Abduct Lovers group was not searchable. It is unclear whether we were removed or if the group itself was deleted. Sky News asked Kik for comment.Other Kik groups Plumb was a part ofBut Plumb's public obsession with Willoughby went beyond the Abduct Lovers group.He was also the admin of another public Kik group with 50 members. Members post images and chat about Holly Willoughby, with some of the discussion sexually explicit in nature.A message on the group seen by Sky News said it's for ""real fans"" of Willoughby and ""ONLY Holly chat and pics are allowed"".While there were no recent messages from Plumb in the group, the group provides an insight into Plumb's online world.The messages viewed by Sky News suggest the group has been used by members to share and discuss images of Willoughby for their sexual gratification.The images of her shared in recent days include an explicit edited fake, created to make it appear as though the presenter was photographed naked with another woman.The sharing of sexually explicit fakes without the consent of the person depicted was made a criminal offence with the passing of the Online Safety Act 2023.Plumb's posts on Willoughby from 2014But beyond Kik, Plumb's social media history shows his obsession was longstanding. We uncovered archived records of Plumb's account on the now-defunct social media platform Google Plus.They show Plumb posted seven times under his real name in 2014. Of these posts, all but one were of a sexual nature and mentioned Willoughby.The court heard Plumb also searched online for ""how to meet people who plan to kidnap celebrities"" and ""killers from Harlow in Essex"".Sky News also analysed Plumb's Facebook account. However, his public posts to friends and in local groups did not discuss or feature Willoughby.Plumb shows 'psychopathic tendencies'Plumb said in court he spent his life online engaging in ""wholesome chat"" but also fantasising about having sex with celebrities, including Willoughby, whom he saw on daytime TV after he became housebound, having gained weight and reaching 35.5 stone.Based on the Kik groups and court reports, criminal psychologist Dr David Holmes says Plumb's behaviour shows ""psychopathic tendencies"" and ""obsessive traits"".While he does not believe Plumb fits entirely within the incel community, Dr Holmes says he has traits that lend themselves to it.Dr Holmes said: ""He's quite happy to impose his will over others and is more of what we call a predatory or resentful stalker. The resentful bit would put him into the category of the incel people. Where there is a sense that they are entitled to a relationship and they should be able to take that relationship by force if necessary.""He said Plumb may have been ""withdrawn from real society possibly as a consequence of his overweight"".Dr Holmes described Plumb as ""someone who has created an online life for themselves in the kind of uncertain knowledge that an offline life is impossible, and therefore that all their hopes and all their dreams are embedded in this online world"".He added: ""The online world as it is and the social media aspect of it basically creates the possibilities for people like Plumb, to carry out these things and to actually harbour and grow these plots. It virtually would be impossible without social media.""Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsQuestions for social media companiesOne expert told Sky News Plumb's case is a symptom of a wider challenge for social media platforms and society to tackle misogyny and hate.Jacob Davey, director of policy & research, counter-hate at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, said this case ""shines a light"" on the way online communities and online spaces can ""facilitate radicalising activity allowing individuals to live out egregious extreme fantasises that provide vectors to them to either influence or discuss these"".He added social media platforms need to ""assess"" both the risk and nature of content on their platforms and take action against activity that violates their guidelines.In relation to Kik, Mr Davey said the platform ""easily facilitates"" anonymity and is ""relatively inscrutable to others"".Sky News has approached Kik for comment.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeKik has faced criticism in the past over moderation on its platform and has previously been used by individuals investigated over crimes of a sexual nature.Kik has a series of community guidelines including a Violent Content and Threats clause, a Hateful Content clause and a Graphic and Violent Content clause which it says users must follow.Sky News asked Kik whether it was aware of the Abduct Lovers group and Gavin Plumb's Kik account and if so, whether the platform took any steps to moderate the accounts or content posted in the group.",https://news.sky.com/story/gavin-plumbs-social-media-history-reveals-darkening-obsession-with-holly-willoughby-13162327

03-07-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,Election 2024: Hundreds of donors turn their backs on the Tories during election campaign,"Of the 248 individuals and organisations which donated to the Tory party in the 2019 General Election, only six have donated so far in this election.And the overall number of donors has dropped significantly. There were 156 Tory donors during the first three weeks of the 2019 election period. Over the same period this year, there were just 30.As part of the ongoing Westminster Accounts series, Sky News and Tortoise Media have collaborated to create a live tracker of all donations made during the election period.The biggest absentee donors include businessman and Brexit supporter Peter Hargreaves, who donated  1m in 2019 - the biggest donation of that campaign.Samuel Power, senior lecturer in politics at the University of Sussex and the author of Party Funding and Corruption, said there was a clear ""desertion"" by Tory donors.""There's just a lot of donors that may be ideologically aligned with the Conservative Party, but are just seeing it as a pointless investment,"" Mr Power told Sky News.The fastest results, the sharpest analysis and an award-winning line up - as the general election unfolds, Sky News will bring you the full story, first.""That's where the big black hole, in terms of Conservative financing, is just those people that don't see it as a good use of that time, don't see it as a wise investment, and are looking at the problems and just staying away - rather than actually moving to the Labor Party.""In contrast, Labour appears to have won back some of its long-time donors who ""sat out"" 2019, according to Mr Power.""Donors that had somewhat deserted the Labour Party, probably since 2010, have been coming home to the Labour Party,"" he told Sky News.The data shows that Labour attracted more donors during the first three weeks of this election than it did during the whole six weeks of the 2019 campaign.And Labour is dominating fundraising during this election. It has so far raised  8.8m, compared to the Conservatives'  1.2m.The Conservatives are only slightly ahead of the Liberal Democrats in third place, who have raised  983,900.Reform is close behind them in fourth. In the second week of the pre-poll period, in which Nigel Farage announced he would be standing, Reform raised the second largest amount of money after Labour. But donations dropped off the next week to lower than the Liberal Democrats. And in fact, it has raised less at this stage of the election than in 2019, when it was called the Brexit Party.Sky News compared donations data for all political parties defined as being in the pre-poll period by the Electoral Commission for 2019 and 2024. These figures do not include public funds.The Conservative campaign fundraising is low in comparison to money before the election was announced. They raised  8,836,834 in the first quarter of 2024, according to the Electoral Commission, compared to Labour's  7,388,160.And in 2023, the Conservatives raised significantly more money -  48m in total compared to Labour's  31m.Duncan Hames, the director of policy at advocacy group Transparency International, told Sky News: ""The extent to which a very small number of individuals are the principal funders of political campaign expenditure in this country has become more acute.""The emergence of the mega donor is very much a contemporary phenomenon.""We definitely think that there is a problem with democracy when political parties are reliant on a small number of wealthy backers... it's unrealistic to assume that these people never expect anything in return.""Donor numbers methodology Sky News compared donations data for all political parties defined as being in the pre-poll period by the Electoral Commission for 2019 and 2024. These figures do not include public funds.The figures for 2024 are likely to be an underestimate.

29-06-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,Election campaign trails: How party leaders are upping the ante as poll day looms,"This week the party leaders made their final pleas to voters. The Labour and Lib Dem leaders visited some of their most ambitious targets so far, while the prime minister took a scattergun approach, fighting for votes in even some of the safest of Tory seats.Watch their journeys this week in our animated map below.This campaign is being fought on new electoral boundaries, with many constituencies undergoing significant changes since 2019.For the purposes of this analysis, we use notional results based on calculations by Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, honorary professors at the University of Exeter, which estimate the 2019 election seat results if they had taken place on the new constituency boundaries.Crunch timeWe're fast approaching election day. In their closing gambits, the Conservatives have been trying to claw back straying voters and convince undecided ones, while Labour have endeavoured to stick to the script and avoid any missteps.The Conservatives are fending off a potential Labour landslide and are fighting on multiple fronts, while both leaders are wary of losing votes to smaller parties or apathy where people believe the result is already a foregone conclusion.The big pictureIt's been a long five weeks for the Tories, whose campaign has been mired with several high-profile embarrassments: from Sunak's D-Day gaffe to the growing sleaze scandal surrounding insider betting allegations at Westminster.This hasn't helped their attempt to narrow the polls, and the campaign has remained deep in defensive territory throughout. The prime minister has visited seats with an average 25% Conservative majority.Nearly 9 in 10 (88%) of Sunak's 51 constituency visits have been to seats his party is defending. Fourteen of those are places where the Conservatives' closest rivals are the Lib Dems, and the remaining 34 in places where Labour is the strongest challenger.In contrast, 84% of Starmer s 44 constituency visits have been to seats Labour are targeting. All but four of them have been places the Tories are defending.Labour's challenge has been to generate enthusiasm for a Starmer government. On average, the target seats he has visited need a 10.5 point vote swing to become Labour gains - just above the figure that Tony Blair achieved in 1997.Labour must achieve higher than this - a record swing of 12 percentage points from the Conservatives - to secure a majority, however, and Starmer has been visiting seats that require a vote swing as high as 18 points.The Labour leader has mostly steered clear of the primarily Conservative vs Lib Dem battlegrounds in the south, but has ventured to parts of the South East that only Blair has previously managed to conquer.Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey has seemingly been having the most fun on the campaign trail, with a series of attention-grabbing stunts including photo ops on rollercoasters and dips in the Thames.All but one of his 40 campaign visits have been to seats the Lib Dems are targeting, including one Labour-held and one SNP-held seat, with the rest of his time spent targeting Conservative-held seats.Data and forensics correspondentLooking at data from Who Targets Me, Sky s partner for our Online Campaign Team, we ve now got a pretty full picture of how the main two parties have using political advertising on social media.The Conservatives have consistently trailed Labour both in terms of spend and in the number of adverts posted (you d expect those to correlate).But there doesn t seem to be any coherence to the current campaign   not even a strategy of retrenchment, as Tom King from Who Targets Me notes:  it appears there is no directive, and every seat is sorting itself out. Labour has maintained its blanket coverage. And the tone of its adverts is very different.They tend to focus on Labour and its central message: 22 per cent of all of the more than 5,500 adverts they ve put up have contained the message  Change .The Conservatives have been a lot more negative. 83 per cent of their adverts mention Labour   and only 1 per cent mention their own leader Rishi Sunak. It s definitely a rearguard action.Hiding in plain sightOne theme that has been shared across the two main parties  campaigns is their reluctance to send their leaders to the public or large crowds.Rishi Sunak has been to see small crowds at many business locations, and the micro-management of his audiences was revealed early in the campaign when at one event it transpired that supposed members of the public were Conservative councillors.Sir Keir Starmer has played on his football links, visiting two stadiums including Northampton Town this week, but has likewise mostly stuck to closely managed events.Read more:Analysis - Sunak's tetchiness over betting scandal speaks volumesHow will Britain's ethnically diverse communities vote?Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeOne leader who hasn't been afraid of crowds is Reform's Nigel Farage. Starting his campaign on a pub bench in Clacton, this week he had something of a homecoming in Newton Abbot where 1,500 spectators came to see him speak on Monday. The town was the location of UKIP's headquarters in their heyday.Sir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, has also had a much more public-facing campaign in his various campaign stunts.The Greens are the only ones to have really made use of celebrity endorsement. This week they won the vocal support of two Hughs - chef Fearnley-Whittingstall and actor Grant.Upping the anteThe types of seats the Labour and Lib Dem leaders have visited have been markedly different this week.Sir Keir Starmer has been to increasingly more ambitious targets, visiting Leicestershire North West this week which requires an 18-point swing for Labour to gain, the highest on his trail so far.That s also been the trend for Sir Ed Davey. In the final week of campaigning, he s visited seats where the Liberal Democrats need a swing of 17 points on average to gain, up from 12 points in the previous week.The prime minister has been less consistent. Indicative of the broad coalition of voters that Johnson built and Sunak has to defend, his visits have spanned from the most marginal defences to what should be the safest of majorities.Popular placesOver the last 37 days, the three English main party leaders have made 135 visits to 119 unique constituencies. That s more than 18% of the UK s seats covered by Sunak, Starmer and Davey.The seats with the most visits, at three apiece, are Redcar in the North East, Wimbledon in London, and Sunak s own constituency Richmond & Northallerton in Yorkshire.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsRedcar, visited twice by Sunak and once by Starmer, is a Conservative defence where the Conservative minister candidate is looking vulnerable to Labour.Davey has his sights set on the highly marginal seat of Wimbledon in London, which the Lib Dems have never won before. He's visited twice, while Sunak has been to the Conservative defence once on the campaign trail.And the prime minister has visited his own constituency three times, most recently this week. He defends a 46.9% majority but some MRP polls say there s a chance he ll lose it.Dr Hannah Bunting is a Sky News elections analyst and co-director of The Elections Centre at the University of Exeter.The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

28-06-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,"Guns, gold and $5m cash: Documents reveal owner of private jet seized in 'gold scam'","Last August, authorities in Zambia raided a private jet, which had landed at the African country s largest airport after flying more than 3,000 miles from Cairo.Acting on a tip, Zambia s Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC) found $5.7m in cash, five pistols and 127kg of what appeared to be gold.Zambian authorities later tested the pieces and discovered they were mostly made up of copper and zinc. This has been a clear case of scamming, gold scamming,  said DEC director Nason Banda at a news conference after the operation.Zambian authorities seized the jet and detained 10 people on board, including six Egyptian nationals. For almost a year, however, the owner of the jet has remained a mystery.Documents obtained by Sky News, in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), show that the plane is owned by prominent Egyptian businessman Ibrahim Al Organi.In an affidavit filed to Zambia s High Court in December, Al Organi identified himself as the owner of the aircraft.Who is Al Organi?The Egyptian businessman is chairman of the Organi Group, a sprawling network of companies in construction, real estate, travel, and security. In January 2023, Al Organi became an official sponsor of Al Ahly, the most successful football team in Africa.Al Organi s affidavit, submitted in a bid to regain possession of the aircraft, says he is the  sole director  of the company World Aviation Sinai International Mountain Limited, which is registered with the aviation authority in San Marino, a tiny landlocked country surrounded by Italy.San Marino aviation registry documents confirm the firm owns the Global Express jet that was detained by Zambian authorities.In the affidavit, Al Organi says neither he nor the plane s management company, Ibis Air, had any connection with the Egyptians who chartered the flight from Cairo to Lusaka.Al Organi did not respond to a further request for comment.Recent developmentsIn April, Zambian authorities released the jet after reaching an agreement with Al Organi's company. Flight tracking data shows the plane flew from Lusaka to Johannesburg on 12 April.The ownership of the plane and its links to Egypt have been subject to speculation since the raid almost one year ago.According to the Associated Press, a journalist in Egypt was briefly detained in August after publishing the names of the Egyptians arrested on-board the plane.Five of those Egyptians were subsequently charged with espionage, but these charges were dropped four days later. The sixth Egyptian, a flight attendant, was released without charge.Five Zambians connected with the plot are currently standing trial in Lusaka on charges of espionage.The Zambian Drug Enforcement Commission and Director of Public Prosecutions declined to comment, citing the ongoing legal cases.The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

25-06-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,One political party is dominating social media - but it's not the one spending the most,"There are two ways to reach voters online: pay for your adverts to end up in front of them - or produce content yourself that gets attention.Throughout the election, we've been tracking the first of those. Labour have been the big digital spenders, with the Conservatives second, and then everyone else a very distant third.But throwing money at it doesn't necessarily fix the attention problem. And actually, some of those spending the least are getting the most interactions.Reform is doing by far and away the best on that metric. This is based on data from CrowdTangle, a social media tracking tool that analyses engagement - how many times someone has seen a post or commented on it. The chart above shows which parties' posts got the most total interactions on Facebook.""Despite being one of the smallest and least formally organised parties, Reform has dominated on Facebook in terms of organic interactions,"" says Kate Dommett, professor of digital politics at the University of Sheffield.""This could be put down to the parties having different numbers of followers, but Reform UK and Labour have nearly identical numbers of page followers, suggesting that Reform is having greater success in getting a response.""Read more in politics:IFS accuses two main parties of 'conspiracy of silence'Sunak says he is not being investigated over betting scandalAnd it's important to look at the growth or otherwise that these parties are having on those pages.Reform is seeing the most page growth, with 32,000 new followers.The Conservative Party by comparison has seen much slower growth, just 0.08%. That's only 596 more people clicking follow over the course of the election, speaking to a sputtering campaign.But the stats themselves hide some important differences. Because an interaction could be a like, it could even be 'love' - but it might also be a frown.We ranked posts based on the amount of 'love' reactions they got.Nigel Farage's post when he announced his candidacy is the most popular so far, with nearly 12,000 'loves'.Sixteen of the top 20 most-loved posts were from Mr Farage.The second most-loved post was from Rishi Sunak, where he told followers you don't need to go to university to succeed in life.And that shows some of the ambiguity. This post incidentally also got the most amount of 'haha' emoji reactions. And if we look into the comments, we can see the types of comments of how it went down.""Totally true! Simply marry a billionaire like Rishi here and you too can have your own swimming pool regardless of your education,"" wrote a lady called Fran.Tsareena Brown commented: ""True. Marrying into a billionaire's family will do just fine.""We're assuming here that they're laughing 'at' rather than laughing with.  Tap here to follow Politics at Jack and Sam's wherever you get your podcasts  And in fact, 11 of the 20 posts with the most laughs were from either Rishi Sunak or his party.But Labour also struggles to cut through online.The Keir Starmer post with the highest interactions - a lengthy, emotional message to his followers about his mum - was liked only 1,922 times Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsEven that's not bad.For all of Ed Davey's social-friendly campaign content, his online presence doesn't appear to be getting a great deal of 'love'.Still not as wet as Rishi Sunak, the post says - a nod to that election announcement outside Number 10 in the pouring rain.But it's not got a whole lot of love either.

22-06-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,Tracking the election campaigns: The seats where polling results have got worse despite leader visits,"We're now more than four weeks into the campaign and can see how the parties are faring in seats they have been targeting, for better or worse.Watch this week's journeys on our animated map below.This campaign is being fought on new electoral boundaries, with many constituencies undergoing significant changes since 2019.For the purpose of this analysis, we use notional results based on calculations by Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, honorary professors at the University of Exeter, which estimate the 2019 election seat results if they had taken place on the new constituency boundaries.Shying away?It is safe to say the campaign is not going to plan for Rishi Sunak. When the prime minister made his surprise election call on 4 July the polls were not looking good for the Conservatives, but it was assumed the gap would narrow in the run-up to election day.The reality has been different. The Conservatives are still 20 points behind, but both main parties have shed support to the Liberal Democrats and Reform - which is proving to be more of an issue for the Conservatives than for Labour.Whereas last week we showed Sunak fighting a lonely battle, this week there were rumours of him backing away from campaigning altogether. He made just six visits this week, a figure which has been gradually declining as the campaign progresses.Despite this slowdown in campaigning, Sunak maintains the overall largest tally of seats visited, at 41 since the start of the campaign compared to 31 for both Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and Liberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey.He was dealt another blow when the latest Sky/YouGov MRP poll was released on Wednesday evening.Comparing this poll, conducted from 11-18 June, to the one fielded more than two weeks earlier from 24 May-1 June, it appears the Conservatives' fortunes are worse now than the already dire state they were in when the election was announced; their projected seat tally has dropped from 140 to 108.Are the visits helping?We can compare the change in performance of parties between these two polls to assess whether things are improving or getting worse for the leaders in areas they have visited.These projections are based on respondents  voting intentions at the time the polls were conducted, with calls for who will win seats rated from lowest to most confident projections, as either: ""tossup"" (too close to call), ""lean"", ""likely"" or ""safe"".For Sunak, 12 of the constituencies he's been to since the start of the campaign are now in a worse position for the Conservatives than earlier in the election campaign.Of course, this might not be directly because of the prime minister s visit, and some trips were made after polling was completed, but it will do little to cheer the faltering campaign s spirits.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsLib Dem threatA particular problem for the Conservatives is the potential efficiency of the Lib Dem vote in this election, picking up votes in just the right places to hurt the Tories.On a projected national vote share of 11.6% - the same as their 2019 result - they are projected to win a massive 67 seats, more than six times the number they notionally won in 2019, and which would be the highest number since the formation of the Lib Dems in 1988. All of their potential gains outside of Scotland are at the expense of the Conservatives.This can be seen in key Con v Lib Dem battlegrounds visited by Sunak: eight of those have moved in favour of the Lib Dems. Places like Wokingham, graced by Sunak in week two and Davey in week three, where the Conservatives have a 23.2% majority, are now leaning more towards the Lib Dems.In 23 of the seats the prime minister has visited, there has been no projected change in fortunes. But 18 of those are ones his party is (still) on course to lose. This includes places like Devon North, which he visited on Tuesday, where a 13.3 point swing is needed for the Liberal Democrats to gain from the Conservatives - and they are expected to do so.Tory gainsThings improved in four of Sunak's previous stops, notably including his home turf visits in Yorkshire. His own constituency Richmond & Northallerton, that he's visited twice, has been upgraded from ""lean"" Conservative hold to ""likely"" hold, and Thirsk & Malton has edged from ""toss-up"" - meaning it s too close to call - to ""lean"" Tory hold.Perhaps his focus on the area is paying dividends.Labour's decrease to a still healthy projected share of 39% means they're doing worse in seven of the constituencies Starmer has visited. Derby South was downgraded from a ""safe"" hold to a ""likely"" hold, with an increase in Reform's vote share between polls eating into Labour's potential majority, and the ""toss-up"" of Finchley & Golders Green in London inching in the Conservatives' favour.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeRead more:Parties raise  5.8m in a weekFarage says West 'provoked' Russia's invasion of UkraineJK Rowling will 'struggle to support' LabourThere has been no change to the predictions in 22 Starmer-visited seats, where Labour remain frontrunners to gain. All bar one - Inverclyde & Renfrewshire West, which they hope to take from the SNP - are currently held by the Conservatives.Things got better for Labour in two seats visited by Starmer. Worthing East & Shoreham, which Starmer visited in the first week of the campaign, was upgraded from a ""likely"" to a ""safe"" gain from the Tories. Nuneaton in the West Midlands similarly went from ""lean"" to ""likely"" since he stopped by on 10 June, just before the second poll.Meanwhile, Davey has the most glowing report card, with 18 of his 31 visited constituencies looking more favourable to the Lib Dems between polls.This includes Carshalton & Wallington, a highly marginal constituency in London where the Lib Dems came second to Conservatives by just 1.3% in 2019 but are now projected to claim a ""safe"" win, up from a lower confidence level of ""lean"" in the previous MRP. Sunak visited the area early on in week one of the campaign while Davey visited this week.Farage factorThe other big winners in vote share over the last few weeks have been Reform, following Nigel Farage s explosive return as leader.Reform s increase in projected vote share to 15.4% would put them in third place nationally, above the Lib Dems. But while this certainly appears to be hurting the Tories in particular, it is less efficient at picking up seats for Reform, of which they are currently projected five.Neither Sunak nor Starmer have visited any of the seats that Reform are now projected to gain. That includes Clacton, where it is now projected ""likely"" that Nigel Farage will overturn the 56.31% Conservative majority.It would be the eighth time lucky for Farage if he does manage to convince voters in Clacton. Over 30 years he has stood in seven different parliamentary constituencies but thus far has failed to win.Reform launched their not-a-manifesto on Monday from Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales; with Farage saying the location was chosen ""because it shows everyone exactly what happens to a country when Labour is in charge"".They placed third here in 2019 but are projected to overtake the Conservatives and finish second to Labour, according to our latest MRP poll.Sunak also took a swipe at Welsh Labour when he was in Clwyd North to launch the Welsh Conservative manifesto on Friday, where he said it was a ""great country, but a country let down by Labour"".Battle for the South WestThis week there has been an increased interest in the South West. Previously a Lib Dem enclave, especially in their 2005 heyday, they had lost all but one of their seats here by 2017 and Bath is the only remaining constituency they are defending.The Lib Dems are looking to make serious headway here, reflected in the number of visits the area has received.This week alone there have been six visits to the region - two by each of the three party leaders vying for seats here. Sunak was seen in Torridge & Tavistock where the Conservatives are expected to fight off the Liberal Democrats with their 41.9% Tory majority.Starmer made a rare defensive visit to Labour's Bristol North West on Monday, while Davey was in Yeovil where his party will need a 13.5 point swing to beat the Conservative candidate.The prime minister has visited 16% of the seats in the South West, more than any of the other leaders have in any other region. Davey has been to 12% of the constituencies here and 11% of those in the South East, highlighting the Liberal Democrats' southern targeting.Looking to appeal to broader sections of the electorate, Starmer has been much more dispersed in his regional campaigning. His maximum is the 7% of seats he has visited in Greater London, closely followed by the 6% he has stopped by in Wales.So far 31% of the constituencies in the South West have been visited by at least one of Sunak, Starmer and Davey. The North West is the least frequented in England, where they've been to 11% of seats. However the parties have been sending other representatives there, such as deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner, and Scotland has been targeted more by the Scottish versions of each party than by the national party leaders.Dr Hannah Bunting is a Sky News elections analyst and co-director of The Elections Centre at the University of Exeter.The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

15-06-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,General election campaign midpoint: Lonely Sunak fights battle on three fronts,"This week the leaders were selling their visions to voters as they launched their manifestos, and Sunak and Starmer went head to head in Grimsby at the Sky News live election special The Battle For Number 10.Watch their journeys in the latest week in our animated map below.This campaign is being fought on new electoral boundaries, with many constituencies undergoing significant changes since 2019.For the purposes of this analysis, we use notional results based on calculations by Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, Honorary Professors at the University of Exeter, which estimate the 2019 election seat results if they had taken place on the new constituency boundaries.Manifesto weekWe're now more than halfway through the general election campaign and voting will soon be under way as postal ballots start to arrive through letterboxes.In the final pushes to persuade the electorate, this week the parties have been releasing their manifestos.The choices they've made about where to launch them reveal a narrative of safety.   Click here to follow the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcasts The prime minister chose Northamptonshire South in the East Midlands to launch the Conservative manifesto, where they have a 42.4% majority.This is Andrea Leadsom's old seat, one of the safer Conservative constituencies in that region. Boundaries have changed over time, but none of its predecessors have been Labour.But it's starting to look like there are no safe Tory seats. Recent Sky News/YouGov MRP polling suggests they could lose it, placing this seat as a ""toss-up"" Conservative hold, i.e. too close to call. If Labour won here, the required swing of 21.2 means they'd be well into decisive majority territory.On Thursday Sir Keir Starmer chose Manchester Central as the launching pad for Labour's manifesto. This is Lucy Powell's seat and her majority is 44.4%.This is home turf, and a rare venture into Labour heartlands for Starmer, who so far has only visited seats his party already hold three times in his 23 constituency tally - a safe choice for a safety first manifesto.   Click here to follow the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcasts Both location choices are key areas of support for the main parties. The Greens did the same in choosing to launch in Hove, the home of their first and only seat in the House of Commons, Brighton Pavilion.Sir Ed Davey, who has been keeping everyone guessing throughout his campaign, made the curious choice of Hackney South & Shoreditch, a seat that has been Labour since its creation, represented by chair of The Public Accounts Committee Meg Hillier since 2005.But he was soon back on the attack in Tory territory, following up with a visit to ride a rollercoaster at Thorpe Park in Surrey.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerWhere are the troops?The prime minister has cut a lone figure on the campaign trail, rarely seen with senior members of his party or indeed visiting their seats.As Sky News revealed earlier this week, his image and Conservative Party branding have often been absent on much of their campaign material. One man who did make an appearance on Andrea Jenkyns' leaflets for Leeds South West was Reform leader Nigel Farage, and that's indicative of Sunak's problem.In the first two weeks he was fighting on two fronts, but now it seems the new Reform leader has just opened a third. Sunak's woeful week ended with a YouGov poll suggesting his party could have now even dropped into third place.So which cabinet ministers in trouble have had a visit from Sunak to boost their chances?This week, none of them, and since the start of the campaign, just two of them.Those were Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride s Devon Central in the first week of campaigning, and Michelle Donelan, Science, Innovation and Technology Secretary in Melksham & Devizes in the second week.He has visited four other ministerial seats, all of which polling has suggested could be at risk. Those were Justin Tomlinson in Swindon North, Jacob Young in Redcar, David Johnston in Didcot & Wantage, and David Rutley in Macclesfield.So far no visit from the PM to the likes of Penny Mordaunt, Johnny Mercer and Grant Shapps, all of whom are said to be in a close fight for their parliamentary careers.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerSir Keir Starmer has also spent little time in shadow cabinet constituencies, instead taking many of them on the road with him to seats he's targeting from the Tories.Some have also been deployed in key areas where they're popular, like deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner who has been spending time in the north of England seats that Labour lost to the Conservatives in recent elections. She's also been hitting ""true blue"" northern areas like Macclesfield and Altrincham & Sale West, which have never been represented by a Labour MP.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsBattle is in the areas that take Labour to a large majorityAt Sky s event on Wednesday, Starmer let slip that he s expecting to be in government.A national uniform swing of 8.3 points from the Conservatives would make Labour the largest party, one of 12.7 would deliver them a majority. If Labour uses its vote more efficiently than in the past and gains extra seats in Scotland then it reduces the overall swing required.So far, Starmer has visited nine target constituencies which require swings of less 8.3 points vs 11 which require a greater vote swing. One of those which he visited this week was Redcar, where Sunak went last week.Labour's candidate Anna Turley is trying to win it back after losing to the Conservatives in 2019. Last week we outlined its importance for each party s campaign.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeHe has only visited five places where the swing required is more than 12.7, such as Nuneaton, a Brexit voting constituency in the West Midlands held by Labour in the early Blair years but Conservative since Cameron. The required swing to gain for Labour is 14.5 points.Twenty-one of the 34 seats that Sunak has visited are Con-Lab battles that he defends. Seven have swings of less than 8.3 for it to be a Labour gain, while eight require swings bigger than 12.7.Then there is the final front on which Sunak is defending: against the Lib Dems. Sunak has been to 11 seats where he s fighting them off, such as Horsham in West Sussex this week where the Lib Dems need a swing of 15.5.All bar two of Davey's 27 visits have been to targets the Tories defend, where the average swing needed is 22.4 points.Dr Hannah Bunting is a Sky News elections analyst and Co-director of The Elections Centre at the University of Exeter.The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

14-06-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,General election: The Conservative candidates ditching the Tory brand,"How bad is the Conservative brand?Bad enough for dozens of its own candidates to avoid using it, according to research from Sky's Online Campaign Team and Who Targets Me.We looked at the adverts published on Facebook and Instagram by 521 Labour and Conservative candidates from 1 May until 12 June.Of these, 376 adverts contained official branding (logos and colours), 104 had some form of partial branding, and 41 had no branding at all.And the vast majority of those with no branding - 38 - were Conservative.Of the 80 Conservative candidates who had partial branding, 59 (73%) only mentioned the party in the funding disclosure - where they were legally obliged to do so. They did not mention the party anywhere else in the text of the advert, or on the visuals if the advert was an image (no videos were watched).Of the 19 Labour candidates, all mentioned the party in the written text above the advert, as well as in the funding declaration.Voter ID rules 'discouraged' some people from voting in general election, watchdog findsElection betting scandal investigation dropped by police - but watchdog could still bring chargesOusted former Labour MP Jonathan Ashworth hints at future return to parliamentMost Labour candidates' adverts are plastered in party branding.But for a number of Conservatives, it's hard to tell at a glance that they're Conservatives.That includes several prominent figures, including veterans' ministers Johnny Mercer, defence secretary Grant Shapps, and former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith.The online adverts are the quantifiable aspect of a trend that, anecdotally, appears to be the case on the ground too.Johnny Mercer completely avoids Conservative branding in his election leaflets. The reverse page mentions the party in small text and in brackets as part of the funding disclosure, where candidates are, again, legally obliged to.And Andrea Jenkyns, first elected as a Conservative MP in 2015 and a former minister, does at least paint her leaflet in true blue.But the first picture is of her posing with the leader of another party entirely - Nigel Farage.It's an unconventional strategy.Speaking on Friday morning, Treasury minister Bim Afolami refused to be drawn on it.""All candidates are fighting their own seats,"" he told Sky News. ""I am not going to comment on Andrea or anyone else, it's up to her how she wants to appeal to her electorate.""It is, however, worth stressing that the majority of Conservative candidates are using party branding.But a significant number think they're better off without it.Or better off with Nigel Farage.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeNote: Sky's Online Campaign Team examined the branding on all political adverts from the main parties. Of the top advertising spenders, only 16 of them were either Lib Dem, Green, Reform or Sinn Fein.

13-06-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,General election: Toolmakers and Haribo - how the Sky News event unfolded online ,"While Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer spent yesterday evening trying to convince voters in Grimsby to back their parties during Sky's TV event, another audience was analysing the pair from afar - on social media.From confessions of the prime minister's love for ""sugary"" treats to others reminding Labour how many times Sir Keir Starmer has said his dad is a toolmaker, there was a lot going on.This is how the audience online received the debate.Using social media listening tool, TalkWalker, Sky News has analysed how well-received both leaders were during the event on TikTok, YouTube and X.The data from TalkWalker shows a large majority of social media users talking about the two leaders were not positive in sentiment - but either negative or neutral.Our search looked at posts using 'Keir Starmer' and 'Rishi Sunak' from accounts which set their location to the United Kingdom and were posted during the hours of Sky's TV special programme. Sir Keir only narrowly beat the prime minister on posts with positive sentiment - scoring 7.2% versus Rishi Sunak on 4.5%.Read more:Starmer performed best overall in Sky News leaders' event - pollStarmer reveals 'worry' for family if he enters No 10The platform uses AI to measure the sentiment of chatter online whether positive or negative - but doesn't include Meta products like Facebook or Instagram.This compares to a snap YouGov poll following last night's event which shows that almost two-thirds - 64% - of those questioned said the Labour leader came out on top, compared to 36% who thought the prime minister did better.Sir Keir's father was a toolmaker - did you know?First in line for grilling was the Labour leader. Pushed on issues like the economy and abandoned pledges, one of the biggest reactions from the audience was his response to taxes and how much he earns.Sir Keir said he accepts that he earns a lot of money in his current role (over  126k), proceeding to repeat a line many have heard from him before. The line didn't just make the audience in Grimsby laugh but was one of the most viral moments from the event online.He said: ""When I grew up my dad was a toolmaker, he worked in a factory, it's true, and my mum was a nurse... and actually we couldn't make ends meet, which isn't actually a laughing matter.""One version of the clip posted on X gained over 700,000 views in the first two hours and is now almost at two million impressions.Others joked online that it's a phrase the Labour leader has used many times before - even the gambling company PaddyPower seemed to jump on the trend posting a video of the popular gif of football fan Lee Judges saying ""he's done it again....""Sunak's guilty pleasure... are HaribosCould you tell the audience something that might make them like you a bit more again?Mr Sunak said people might think he has a ""healthy lifestyle"", but in fact he admitted to having an ""appalling diet"" and eats an ""enormous amount of sugar"" - with the prime minister naming Haribos and Twix among his favourites.Memes of the prime minister and his love for sugar soon emerged on X. Other parody accounts tweeted ""vote for me because I eat Haribos"" - featuring a picture of the prime minister last night.What were the other parties doing?While last night's programme only featured the Labour and Conservative leaders, some of the other parties did chime in.The Liberal Democrats took to X to jab at the prime minister - although it wasn't focused on policy and more on his appearance.Meanwhile, the SNP shared a post from candidate Alison Thewliss which claimed Sir Keir's answers in last night's event ""confirmed"" that Labour are ""not serious about child poverty"".As last night's event was taking place, Sky News analysis of the TikTok, Facebook and X official accounts of the other parties - Liberal Democrats, the Green Party, Reform UK, Plaid Cymru and the SNP, shows that most of the parties seemed rather quiet on their social media accounts with few or no posts about last night's event.Meanwhile the official accounts for the Green Party, Reform UK and Plaid Cymru show the parties instead posted about their own campaigns and did not react online to Sir Keir and Mr Sunak's performances in the event.This article is part of the Online Election project - a Sky News initiative to cover how the campaign is playing out online, led by Tom Cheshire who is our Online Campaign correspondent throughout.The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

09-06-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,Tracking the election campaigns: South of England emerges as a major battleground,"Other events slowed the campaign this week, hurting Rishi Sunak more than Sir Keir Starmer. Both party leaders visited fewer but more marginal constituencies than last week.Watch their journeys in our animated map below.This campaign is being fought on new electoral boundaries, with many constituencies undergoing significant changes since 2019.For the purposes of this analysis, we use notional results based on calculations by Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, Honorary Professors at the University of Exeter, which estimate the 2019 election seat results if they had taken place on the new constituency boundaries.Battle buses are goThe first televised debate and commemoration of the 80th anniversary of D-Day means there s been less time on the campaign trail this week. Overall this has spelt trouble for Sunak, who faced widespread criticism for his ""mistake"" in leaving Normandy to return to the campaign early.That wasn't his only bit of bad news as the Sky/YouGov MRP poll released on Monday showed his party to be on course for a wipe-out, and his absence left room for Reform UK to drum up support at Nigel Farage's rally.While the prime minister and Starmer may have taken their campaigning foot off the gas this week, they kicked off Saturday by each launching a new battle bus.In his first visit to the North East, Sunak chose the aptly-named Redcar to launch his blue bus. It s not the first time its colourful name has been evoked. On election night in 2019, Boris Johnson claimed ""we turned Redcar Blue-car"" and it signalled a collapse for Labour in the Red Wall.Just a 5.5 point swing is needed for Labour to take Redcar from the Conservatives. The Sky/YouGov MRP poll indicated its old MP, Labour candidate Anna Turley, is likely to achieve that. It seems it won't be blue-car for long.The prime minister then travelled to Blyth & Ashington. Its predecessor seat was the first Tory gain in 2019 but boundary changes now estimate it's a Labour defence. There's little prospect for Sunak to flip it as our MRP poll puts Reform UK in second place ahead of the Conservatives.Starmer joined Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner to launch her own battle bus. They chose Boris Johnson s old seat of Uxbridge & South Ruislip to start her 5,000 mile journey around the country. In a constituency where ULEZ may have cost them a 2023 by-election, there s some irony in turning over the diesel engine for the first time here.A calmer week with smaller majoritiesStarmer's pace of campaign visits slowed, hitting an average of 0.6 compared to 1.2 per day in the first week of the campaign. Sunak's pace similarly halved, down from 2.2 visits a day to 1.1 this week.Both main party leaders have ventured to more marginal seats in week two. Last week we showed the Conservatives in deep defensive territory where the average majority they were defending was 23.5%. This week that s dropped to 18.1%, but the Sky/YouGov MRP poll still suggests all but one will fall to either Labour or the Liberal Democrats, while the remaining Conservative seat, Melksham & Devizes, is a toss-up that could go either way.Of those won by the Conservatives in 2019, the average majority that Labour would have to overturn in the target seats they visited last week was 19.5%. Whereas the average between the three stops this week is a more modest 8.1%.The leader that bucks this trend is Sir Ed Davey. All nine of his visits last week were Conservative-held targets with an average majority of 15.6%. That jumped to 25.3% this week but the Tories are in such dire straits that the MRP poll suggests these are winnable targets for Davey's party. His stop in Shropshire North on Tuesday, where the Liberal Democrats came third in 2019, shows his campaign to be just as much about message as it is about gaining an MP.It demonstrates the scale of the challenge for the Lib Dems, who have only 16 target seats that require less than 5 point vote swing.Regional battlegroundsThere are now 54 of the 650 seats that have been visited during the campaign by Sunak, Starmer or Davey.The South East seems to be garnering the most attention with 12 visits overall. This highlights the importance of the region for all of the English parties. There are 91 constituencies here, including the Greens' only seat of Brighton, and a swathe of Liberal Democrat targets.Eighty-one of these 91 seats were won by the Conservatives in 2019. The Sky/YouGov MRP poll suggests this number could be slashed by more than half, leaving them with 37 seats. The majority (28) could go to Labour, the poll suggests, and the rest to the Lib Dems.This is by no means the most devastating regional outcome for the Conservatives, who could potentially be completely wiped out in the North East and North West.As with any poll, there is uncertainty attached to these numbers, and it only reflects voter attitudes at the time that they were polled - from 24 May to 1 June, before Nigel Farage re-entered the race.The absence of the main protagonists from the campaign trail this week let Farage dominate the news coverage. Supporters of the Conservative s electoral threat gathered in Clacton where Reform s Nigel Farage hopes to repeat UKIP s only general election success.While Sunak has visited all regions at least once, there are four regions which Starmer is yet to reach. The Labour leader hasn t been to the North East, South West, Yorkshire & The Humber or Northern Ireland. He finishes his campaigning week in London, a region he s visited three times - a joint favourite with the North West and South East.Neither main party leader made it to Scotland this week, but SNP leader John Swinney visited at least five constituencies north of the border. Two of these they're expected to hold, but three are considered toss-ups in our MRP. The party launched their battle bus from Glasgow North, a constituency with a 13.4% SNP majority that could still be gained by Labour.The prime minister headed back to the South West on Friday, making it his most visited region. He stopped by three constituencies, and visited another four in the previous week.So far, Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride in Devon Central is the only cabinet member to have hosted the prime minister, suggesting that he might be considered more of a hindrance than a help to their re-election chances.Many of the cabinet are fighting close battles, with 12 of the 26 who are standing at the election projected to potentially lose their seats in the Sky/YouGov MRP Poll.The three constituencies of Wimbledon, Bury, and Harpenden & Berkhamsted have racked up the most visits so far, with Sunak and Davey spending time in both Wimbledon and Harpenden, and Sunak and Starmer visiting Bury North. They are all Conservative seats, two with majorities smaller than 2.5%. Wimbledon is third on the Liberal Democrats targets list, Bury North placing seventh on Labour s.Dr Hannah Bunting is a Sky News elections analyst and Co-director of The Elections Centre at the University of Exeter.The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

06-06-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,Sky News analysis identifies American-made bomb at Gaza school strike ,"Overnight, Israeli forces targeted a school in Nuseirat, a town in the central Gaza Strip.In a statement given on 6 June, officials at the Hamas-run Gaza Government Media Office said 40 people are confirmed to have been killed.According to the same officials, 14 of the dead are children. They said a further 23 children were wounded in the strike.Discussing the strike, an Israeli military spokesperson claimed Hamas fighters were present at the school, and steps had been taken to reduce the risk of civilian casualties.According to experts, a fragment visible in a video verified by Sky News can be identified as part of an American-made GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB).The location of the strikeSky News verified the location of this strike by matching video taken in the aftermath to satellite imagery.UK and US split over Israel after British government suspends some arms salesIsrael-Hamas conflict: Something will have to give as pressure grows on Benjamin NetanyahuWho are the six Israeli hostages confirmed dead?The location was reported by those with knowledge of the area as being a school in Nuseirat. Visible features, including a raised roof section allowed Sky News to determine the precise location within the area.The specific building hit is in the south of a large complex housing school buildings. Satellite imagery captured by Planet on 24 and 28 May shows it lies less than 100 meters from an area occupied by tents.Weapon fragment visible in footageIn a video posted to Instagram shortly after the attack, pieces of a munition can be seen on the floor surrounded by debris.Sky News matched this section of video to the scene by comparing a hole in the ceiling to a photograph captured in the daytime following the strike.The presence of a distinctive orange and white building visible in the background of the reference photograph confirms it was taken in the building identified by Sky News.Identifying the weapon usedRahul Udoshi, a weapons specialist at the defence intelligence company Janes, said both the appearance of the object and the damage seen in the video point to it being a  GBU-39 SDB nose cone. Former US Army explosive ordnance disposal technician Trevor Ball also concluded the fragment was from a GBU-39, telling Sky News, the bomb ""has a very distinct solid nose section of the bomb body that gives the munition its capability to penetrate concrete structures"".Mr Ball confirmed the damage visible at the scene was consistent with the use of this weapon.The GBU-39 is a guided glide bomb deployed by aircraft. GPS-assisted, it is designed to facilitate precise, targeted attacks.Made in AmericaThe GBU-39 SDB has recently been the subject of controversy, having been identified by Sky News and others as the munition used in a strike that killed dozens in Rafah.As was reported at the time, the GBU-39 is manufactured in the United States. According to Sipri Arms Transfers Database,1,000 were sent to Israel in late 2023.The delivery was expedited by Boeing following the 7 October attack and the bombs were flown to Israel from a US airbase, Bloomberg reported.False claims concerning supposed Indian origin go viralThe day after this strike, a video showing a piece of metal went viral on social media sites, with users claiming it proved a weapon from India was used.While the object in question has the word  INDIA  clearly stamped on it, it is not part of a munition.A search of the text visible on the object led Sky News to an eBay listing. Sold in lots of six for $10.49 each, they are described as  Screw In Bell Box Hole Plugs . There is no record of them being used as a component in military hardware.An expert consulted by Sky News confirmed that it does not resemble part of a munition.The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

06-06-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,Which constituencies are being targeted the most by online political adverts?,"When Nigel Farage announced his candidacy, he boasted: ""We haven't spent a bean on Facebook pushes or advertising.""But the data shows Reform has, in fact, spent a significant number of beans.More than  3,800 has been spent by the party's candidate in Great Yarmouth, on more than 50 Facebook and Instagram adverts since the election was called on 22 May.Because tech platforms like Meta and Google publish regular updates to political advertising spending, it's possible to track which constituencies campaigns are pouring money into. Sky News, in partnership with Who Targets Me, which tracks digital political adverts, can reveal the key battlegrounds so far.Hendon, Rochester and Strood, Welwyn Hatfield and Croydon South in Greater London and the home counties, and Rossendale and Darwen in Lancashire, are the places with the biggest ad spend from multiple advertisers - the constituencies where different parties are spending the most to try to swing the election for their candidate.Hendon tops the list with  26,138 being spent by all parties up until 2 June.But with different budgets for each party, the amount being spent varies significantly, from hundreds, to thousands, of pounds.From 22 May to 1 June, Labour has poured the most money into Dover and Deal, with the local candidate spending  19,200.Hendon has seen the highest Conservative spend, with  25,483 forked out by the local party candidate.'I've been bombarded with adverts'Ynys Mon has been another popular place for Tory money, with the party's candidate spending more than  10,000 on online adverts in the week leading up to 2 June.Katie Hayward, an award-winning beekeeper in Anglesey (the constituency of Ynys Mon) says she has been bombarded with the ensuing ads and has stopped checking her social media account as a result.""In the last three weeks. I literally couldn't go a minute without seeing the MP's face telling me how wonderful she was, and it must have cost a fortune. But I got to the point where I don't want to check my Facebook,"" she said.""I've just ended up switching off my social media and not being able to look at it because it's physically made me sick.""However, Kate Dommett, a professor of digital politics at the University of Sheffield, said ""most people really don't pay that much attention to politics"" and this could pose a real challenge to the parties.Read more: Reform UK may be winning the first TikTok electionShe added: ""We're also seeing them turn to more digital media than ever before to use both organic content, but also these paid adverts to really try and get their message across.""They're consistently generating content that they can try and maximize the chance that ordinary people will pay attention to what they're saying.""Where else are parties targeting?A smaller party with a smaller budget, the Liberal Democrat candidate in Witney has spent  2,345 on political advertising.But the Green Party has spent thousands trying to shore up a win in Bristol Central. No adverts are currently active, according to Meta, but it ran two versions of its most popular ad, which featured Keir Starmer, and reached approximately 30,000 people and cost it up to  4,500. Data shows it targeted under-35s the most.Amelia Jacob, co-editor of Bristol University's student newspaper Epigram, said: ""It's mainly on Instagram and Twitter I've seen more adverts for the Greens.""""I've really noticed an increase since the election was called - but it hasn't reached the level of feeling like spamming,"" the 22-year-old said.Read more: The key seats to watch out for in the 2024 electionSam Jeffers, executive director of Who Targets Me, says it's extraordinary that the Greens have targeted such a small constituency with the biggest social media spend in the country.But with the main Green candidate standing down in Brighton, the Greens need an MP and are doing what they can to ensure that happens.""Bristol has a lot of green councillors and has been a long-term target for the Green Party. So, this is the most sensible place to spend,"" Mr Jeffers said.For the SNP, its candidate in West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine attracted the most money - but at  392, this is significantly less than what other parties have spent.Click to subscribe to the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcastsPlaid Cymru had a similar small spend, putting  366 into three online adverts in Ceredigion Preseli.The types of adverts being seen on Facebook, specifically, is ""very static,"" said Professor Dommett, compared to more creative attempts on TikTok (which does not allow paid political advertising).""Videos of parliament, videos of politicians - there doesn't seem to be a huge amount that is trying to grab attention,"" she said.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerThe Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

05-06-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,Labour attracts largest following across social media platforms ,"As the country heads towards a general election, political parties have been competing through social media to get their messages to the public.Sky News tracked the performance of the six highest polling parties across X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, TikTok and Facebook to see how the race for online audiences is shaping up in the early days of the election campaign.X (Formerly Twitter)Using the social media monitoring tool SocialBlade, Sky News tracked the number of followers across each of the parties' accounts on X (formerly Twitter).Over the last 30 days, Reform UK saw the largest increase in the number of users following its official account, which rose by over 11,000.The Labour Party performed similarly, ending the period with 9,366 additional followers. The Conservatives achieved less than half of this increase, netting 4,379.The SNP performed the worst over this timeframe, ending with 159 new followers.While Reform performed best on the platform in the last 30 days, this has done little to shift the overall picture. In terms of total number of followers, Labour sits at just over 1,020,000 followers, followed by the Conservative Party at 623,731.Politics latest: Labour to take action against MPs who defied Starmer on winter fuel voteWhat Trump v Harris means for BritainMillions of pensioners will lose winter fuel payments as government wins vote on cutThe four remaining parties are relatively neck and neck on the platform, all sitting at around roughly a third of Labour's total.InstagramOn Instagram, Labour's lead is less pronounced. Currently, the party sits at just under 295,000 followers to the Conservative Party's 207,795.Of the six parties, the Liberal Democrats have the smallest following on the platform, with just under 44,000 users.Over the last 30 days, Labour has performed relatively strongly on the platform, increasing their number of followers by over 20,600. The next biggest increase was achieved by the Green Party, followed by Reform, the Liberal Democrats, the Conservatives, and SNP respectively.TikTokTikTok rounds the number of followers displayed on an account down to the nearest milestone. The increments displayed vary as the number of followers an account has increased.While less data is available for TikTok, the Labour Party's recently launched account had the most followers, with over 165,900.Reform, which unlike Labour and the Conservatives has had an official TikTok presence since 2022, had the second largest following, at over 141,000.The Conservative Party, which also recently launched its account on the platform, had less than a third of Labour's following, at over 51,700 users.Of the six highest polling parties, the Liberal Democrats has the least followers on TikTok.TikTok allows users to view how many times a page's posts have been liked by users. Of the six parties, Labour came out on top attracting more than 3.6 million likes on its posts. Across all its content, Reform has the second-highest total, with over 1.4 million likes.FacebookOn Facebook, Labour has the largest audience, with more than 1,069,000 users following its official page. The Conservative Party has the second-largest following, at more than 752,000.In the last 30 days, Reform UK has had the biggest jump in number of followers, ending the period with an audience increase of more than 12,000.Compared to their total number of followers, the gains of the parties were modest in this time. The SNP was an outlier, ending the period with just over 400 fewer followers on Facebook.What these numbers tell usOn the state of the race on social media, Kate Dommett, professor of digital politics at the University of Sheffield, said ""Across all four platforms the Conservatives are at a disadvantage to Labour, with just over 900,000 fewer followers.""On the significance of this, Dommett said while it was ""no guarantee of success,"" this disparity places the Conservatives at ""an apparent disadvantage when it comes to communicating with electors.""On the performance of Reform UK specifically, Dommett noted the party ""is punching above its weight on many platforms"" by attracting a competitive number of followers compared to more established parties.",https://news.sky.com/story/labour-attracts-largest-following-across-social-media-platforms-13148421
02-06-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,Rishi Sunak's campaign route suggests a defensive approach to fight off Labour and Lib Dems,"The prime minister has taken a defensive approach, signalling the Conservatives' worry about being so far behind in the polls.Sir Keir Starmer's visits show the scale of their ambition and highlight Labour's awareness of the challenge they face. They need to gain 125 seats to win the smallest possible majority.This campaign is being fought on new electoral boundaries, with many constituencies undergoing significant changes since 2019.For the purposes of this analysis, we use notional results based on calculations by Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, honorary professors at the University of Exeter, which estimate the 2019 election seat results if they had taken place on the new constituency boundaries.Defending deep into Tory territoryRishi Sunak's very first campaign stop was Erewash in the East Midlands, a seat that should be considered safe with its 22% Conservative majority, but one he clearly thinks could be vulnerable.A Labour victory here would be at the cusp between Labour becoming the largest party in a hung parliament or taking an overall majority, if similar levels of voter swing were replicated at a national level.The last time Labour held Erewash (which has not undergone boundary changes in this cycle) was from 1997 to 2010, under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown's leaderships.Labour ambitiousLabour's visit to nearby Derbyshire Mid in the East Midlands shows the scale of their boldness. They need more than a 16-point swing to take the seat from the Tories, but their recent mayoral wins might mean they are feeling confident about convincing the voters here.These stops in the Midlands show the regions to be a key battleground between the two main parties. The Conservatives had 76 MPs across the East and West, so it's crucial for their general election fortunes. The extent of Labour success here could be the difference between them being the largest party or gaining a decisive majority.The range of seats visited by Sir Keir demonstrate just how ambitious Labour are in their targets. They aren't shying away from places with big Conservative majorities, and kicking off their campaign in Kent tells us they think they can win in regions only Blair managed to conquer.Reform threatTory troubles in Kent could also be complicated by the challenge of Reform. In Dover and Deal - where the Conservative Natalie Elphicke defected from Con to Lab - leader Richard Tice focused on immigration. The decision of Reform's honorary president Nigel Farage not to stand as a candidate in this election was one piece of good news for the Conservatives, at least.In total, 16 of Mr Sunak's 18 trips were to seats that the Conservatives are defending, 11 of which are vulnerable to Labour based on current polling estimates which suggest a swing of 16 points.But that hasn't stopped Sunak trying to defend what some might think is now beyond defensible. The most marginal seat he's visited so far is Vale of Glamorgan, where he took a trip to a brewery in Barry. Labour only requires a swing of 2.6 points to win this seat, so it seems like an optimistic majority to defend.Interestingly for a leader under pressure with many constituencies to defend, Sunak found time for a trip to Belfast East, where the Conservatives don't field a candidate. Both were part of his opening gambit of a whistle-stop tour of all the four nations to present a prime ministerial image.Lib-Dem southern frontThe prime minister is also having to fight on two fronts - with the Liberal Democrats closing in on several seats across the South of England. He visited four key Lib Dem targets, including Chesham and Amersham which has recently had a Liberal Democrat MP for the first time due to their resounding 2021 by-election victory.There are 65 seats across the South West and South East where the Conservatives' closest challengers are the Liberal Democrats. All nine of the seats Ed Davey has been to are areas where the Lib Dems came second in 2019. And all in places that swung towards the Lib Dems in 2019 or which they held before their electoral collapse in 2015.Davey first went to Eastbourne and enjoyed an ice cream in a key target seat where they need a 2.1 point swing to beat the Conservative candidate. He launched his Yellow Hammer 1 battle bus from Cambridgeshire South, and on Thursday he went on a waterslide in Frome & East Somerton, the constituency that will replace Somerton & Frome that they won in a 2023 by-election. That's the kind of success they will be looking to replicate and the Tories will be hoping to avoid.Labour's eyes on the prizeEight Conservative-defended seats have had the pleasure of a visit from Sir Keir Starmer, but he has also found time to venture into SNP territory in Scotland. Why? Well, Labour are also taking aim at John Swinney and his party's troubles.Every seat Labour can win off the SNP in Scotland reduces the number they need from the Tories directly in England and Wales for a majority.The Glasgow constituencies that were once dominated by Labour are key battlegrounds. So, unsurprisingly, the Labour leader chose to head to Glasgow East. This has had significant boundary changes, resulting in an estimated 15% majority for the SNP.Scottish strategiesThe new SNP leader Mr Swinney launched their campaign from Edinburgh, where they hold three of the five seats around the Scottish capital city. Some polling suggests Labour might take all three at this election.He also visited Dumfries, an area served by two constituencies that the SNP hope to take from the Conservatives. They need swings of under five percentage points to do so. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack's decision to stand down in Dumfries and Galloway may suggest he thinks the Tories' prospects of defending it are slim.While there are few Labour seats many would argue are vulnerable, the party still has its defensive issues - one of which is arguably the Greens.They kicked off their campaign in Bristol where they are hoping to have some success in the election.Voting patterns in recent local elections indicate that they could take up to three of the five constituencies in the area, all of which were won by Labour in 2019.Dr Hannah Bunting is a Sky News elections analyst and Co-director of The Elections Centre at the University of Exeter.The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

30-05-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,Reform UK may be winning the first TikTok election,"If this is the first TikTok election, you might be surprised at who's winning.On the youngest, buzziest social media platform, Reform UK - whose vote tends somewhat towards the elderly - has the most followers, 125,500, just ahead of Labour on 108,500.Politics live: Abbott tells rally she won't be 'intimidated'But others are catching up fast - and how they're using it reveals a lot about a key digital battleground in this election, one of the only arenas where money doesn't buy you influence.Because this is new territory. ""It's worth noting that the three major parties are really new to the game,"" says Kate Dommett, professor of digital politics at the University of Sheffield.No major party had much of a TikTok presence before the election was called. Now they're racing to build them on the fly.Labour has found success by posting lots of videos, and using rapid reaction memes like this, which has racked up millions of likes.Voter ID rules 'discouraged' some people from voting in general election, watchdog findsElection betting scandal investigation dropped by police - but watchdog could still bring chargesOusted former Labour MP Jonathan Ashworth hints at future return to parliamentCompare that to the Conservatives, who have posted only eight videos so far, most of them featuring senior party figures speaking to camera.Or compare that to the Liberal Democrats, who only launched their TikTok account on Tuesday - they've got the same meme-heavy approach as Labour.Why does that matter?""I'd invest everything in organic TikTok content,"" says Sean Topham. ""I think that's got the best opportunity to penetrate, catch fire, get the attention of people, for all the right reasons.""Mr Topham has worked with previous Conservative campaigns and his consultancy, Topham Guerin, was part of last year's victorious general election campaign in New Zealand.""Catching fire"" is important - and it's also why Reform's impressive follower count may not ultimately matter.Read more:The key seats to watch out for in the general electionHow 'TikTok idiots' are disrupting police investigationsCall to de-select Liz Truss over appearance on 'hateful platform'""That's never really been the measure on TikTok because your content can organically catch fire and perform really well,"" Topham says. ""You don't need to have 125,000 followers to have 10 to 20 million views on a video.""And that's really where the emphasis could or should be for campaigns - creating good content that overwhelms the size or immediate reach of your profile.""Mr Topham convinced the now New Zealand prime minister, in his fifties, to do ""get ready with me"" (GRWM) videos, but also mixed that with more serious policy videos.""The prime minister would come up to us after a few days campaigning, saying people are coming up to me and they only recognise me from TikTok. So it just goes to show that the cut-through happens not just with younger voters as well. There's a lot of middle-aged and older demographics increasingly using TikTok to get their news and information, and they use it.""There's also another dynamic. Having seen the trouble that other platforms have gotten into, TikTok has a blanket ban on political advertising.The millions of pounds we have already seen poured into Instagram and YouTube don't work here. So organic reach becomes key.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsAnd, behind closed doors, both parties have tools for boosting that reach.The Conservatives have been heavily pushing their Share 2 Win app. It makes it very easy for users to share messages from Conservative HQ to various social media platforms. Notably, TikTok is not one of them.The more you share on your own social platforms, the more coins you earn, with a chance to jump up the leaderboard.Labour has a slightly different emphasis. Its Labour digital campaigners group runs on WhatsApp and offers links to national and local graphics and encourages people to send in their own stories and why people may be voting Labour.The idea is not simply to share centrally approved content, though. At a recent online seminar over Zoom, on how to master the ""digital door knock"", the main points were to share messages organically and through friends and family groups online, rather than repost videos of politicians.""Keep it personal"" was the title of one of the slides, whilst another gave four tips for telling a good story - one of the tips being ""don't be too political"".""That sharing from your friends, from your family, can be more persuasive than just kind of saying something that's broadcast from a political party,"" Professor Dommett explains.""So this is where organic comes in. It's something that pops up, you know, it's often shared by someone that we know, and therefore it's likely to resonate a little bit more.""",https://news.sky.com/story/reform-uk-may-be-winning-the-first-tiktok-election-13145329
22-05-2024,SkyNews,Data & Forensics,Election 2024: The key seats to watch out for as date set for 4 July,"The Conservatives secured an 80 seat majority in the 2019 general election.They would have won by even more - defending a majority of 94 - if that vote had taken place on new boundaries that the 4 July election will be fought on.They have lost several seats to defections and at by-elections since then, but it's still a strong position to be starting from.However, they are also more than 20 points behind in the polls just six weeks out from a general election. Never before has a government recovered from a poll deficit this large, this close to polling day.After 14 years of Conservative government, is Keir Starmer about to take Labour to victory?To secure an outright majority of the smallest possible size, his party need to take 125 seats on a record-breaking uniform swing of 12.7 percentage points, although making sizeable gains in Scotland or efficiently targeting key constituencies could lessen the challenge.Here are a list of seats that Labour doesn't hold, ranked by the smallest swing they would need to take it from the party that does:If you're not sure of the name of the seat you're in now there have been boundary changes, use our postcode lookup to find out.Read more: How the electoral impact of new battlegrounds are calculatedYou can also see who would have won in that area if it had been in place in 2019, and what some of the key demographics of your new area are and how they compare to the rest of the country.The Conservatives will defend 372 seats at this election, based on estimated results of the 2019 election if it had taken place on the new boundaries.Labour are in second place in 276 of those.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsWill the challenge of Reform, who didn't stand in Conservative-held seats in 2019, mean that they are more vulnerable in some of their safer seats on paper?Here are a list of Conservative seats that have the smallest majorities, and who is in second place.The Lib Dems are in second place in 92 seats overall, 85 of them are defended by Conservatives.Most of these seats are in the south of England - 40 are in the South East and 25 in the South West.These are the seats where the Lib Dems start second to the Tories, and where in the country they are.The battle in Scotland is likely to be especially interesting this time around.There is much speculation that Labour could take several seats from the SNP.Labour are only defending one seat, but currently lead in the polls after John Swinney replaced Humza Yousaf as SNP leader and First Minister on 6 May.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeA swing of 10 points from the SNP would give Labour 15 additional seats, but a 13-point swing means 27 Labour gains.Here are all the seats that the SNP are defending and what swing is required for them to lose to the second-placed party in each.The Sky News poll tracker currently has the Conservatives on 23.2%, with Labour on 44%, and Reform rising above the Lib Dems as the third-placed party on 11.2%.Rishi Sunak will of course be hoping that his party can narrow that 21-point Labour lead over the next six weeks of the campaign.The new boundaries post interesting challenges for all parties, read some of our analysis from earlier in the year here:Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerThe Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.
