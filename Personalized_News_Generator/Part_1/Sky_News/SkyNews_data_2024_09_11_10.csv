Rates are forecast to be brought down to 4.75% at that point.Political reactionIn response to the figures Chancellor Rachel Reeves said:""I am under no illusion about the scale of the challenge we face and I will be honest with the British people that change will not happen overnight.

11-09-2024,SkyNews,UK,Inquiry to examine murder of Belfast lawyer Pat Finucane,"The UK government has announced a public inquiry into the murder of Belfast lawyer Pat Finucane, who was shot dead by loyalist terrorists in 1989.His killing became one of the most notorious of the Northern Ireland troubles, raising the issue of collusion between loyalist paramilitaries and British state forces.Mr Finucane, 39, was shot 14 times in front of his wife and three children as they sat eating a meal in their Belfast home.He had come to prominence as an effective defence solicitor, representing IRA members and loyalists accused of terrorist offences at the height of the conflict.During an inquest into his death, police refuted his killers' claims that he had been a member of the IRA but their investigation went nowhere.Former Metropolitan Police Commissioner John Stevens, who was appointed to investigate claims of collusion, found that two agents had been involved in Mr Finucane's murder.In 2001, the government appointed a Canadian judge to examine the case and vowed to hold a public inquiry if he found evidence of collusion.That judge found ""strong evidence"" of collusion, including that MI5 had been aware of the threat in advance, but the government reneged on its commitment.In 2011, and still under pressure to hold a public inquiry, the government asked a former UN war crimes prosecutor to review the case again.When Sir Desmond de Silva's report was published, the then Prime Minister David Cameron apologised to the Finucane family for ""frankly shocking levels of collusion"".Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsMr Finucane's widow Geraldine has led a tireless legal campaign.
