11-09-2024,SkyNews,UK,UK economy continued to flatline in July recording no growth as Labour came to power - ONS,"There was no growth in the UK economy in July, official figures show.It's the second month of stagnation, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said as GDP - the measure of everything produced in the UK - flatlined in the weeks following the election of the Labour government.The flatline was not expected by economists, who had anticipated growth.Money blog: Online fashion giant U-turns on returns feeEconomists polled by the Reuters news agency forecast the economy would expand by 0.2%.Some signs of growthBut there's ""longer-term strength"" in the services sector meaning there was growth over the last three months as a whole and 0.5% expansion in the three months up to July.Among the G7 group of industrialised nations, the UK had the highest growth rate for the first six months of 2024.Why stagnation?While there was growth in the services sector, led by computer programmers and the end of strikes in health, these gains were offset by falls for advertising companies, architects and engineers.Manufacturing output fell overall due to ""a particularly poor month for car and machinery firms"", the ONS said, while construction also declined.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeWhat will it mean for interest rates?Market expectations are for interest rates to remain unchanged by the Bank of England when they meet next week to consider their next move in the fight against inflation.The central bank had raised the rate and made borrowing more expensive to reduce inflation.A cut in November, at the next meeting of rate-setters, is expected. Rates are forecast to be brought down to 4.75% at that point.Political reactionIn response to the figures Chancellor Rachel Reeves said:""I am under no illusion about the scale of the challenge we face and I will be honest with the British people that change will not happen overnight. Two-quarters of positive economic growth does not make up for 14 years of stagnation.""That is why we are taking the long-term decisions now to fix the foundations of our economy.""",https://news.sky.com/story/uk-economy-continued-to-flatline-in-month-labour-came-to-power-official-figures-13212719

10-09-2024,SkyNews,UK,Winter fuel payment changes - are you still eligible?,"The winter fuel payment has been scrapped for millions of pensioners.The government announced the change at the end of July, along with a raft of other cuts to fill a £22bn ""black hole"" in public finances.MPs have now voted to allow the controversial plan to go ahead, which Chancellor Rachel Reeves says will save about £1.5bn each year.The payment is aimed at helping pensioners pay for higher fuel bills during the colder months, but now only the country's poorest pensioners will get financial aid.Wondering if you're still eligible for the payment?Here is what you need to know:Who is now eligible for the winter fuel payment?The winter fuel payment will now be limited to people over state pension age who are receiving pension credit or a limited number of other benefits.These benefits are: Income support; income-based jobseeker's allowance; income-related employment and support allowance; universal credit.The changes mean about 1.5 million people will be eligible - down from 11.4 million when the payment was available to anyone over the age of 66.How much is the payment?The payment is £200 for households receiving pension credit where the recipients are all under 80.If someone in the household is over the age of 80, the payment is increased to £300.What were the rules before?Previously, the payments were available to everyone above state pension age.Last year, the base rate of £200 was paid to everyone born before 25 September 1957, while those born before 25 September 1943 received £300.This was boosted by a £300 per household pensioner cost of living payment.How is the payment made?Most people get the winter fuel payment automatically, and those eligible should receive a letter in the autumn saying how much they will get.Read more from Sky News:How would an outdoor smoking ban work?How could the government change council tax?Voter ID rules 'discouraged' some people from voting in general electionKeep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsWho is eligible for pension credit?Pension credit is available to pensioners whose income falls below a certain threshold - the payment tops up their income to this amount.For people with a partner, income is calculated together.Income includes state and private pensions, earnings, and social security benefits including a carer's allowance.But not everything counts as income - disability payments, housing benefit, and council tax reduction are among the benefits that aren't counted.Pension credit tops up your weekly income to £218.15 if you're single and £332.95 if you have a partner.Pension credit is often described as a ""gateway benefit"" as it can lead to further support, including help with housing costs, council tax and heating bills.Previous estimates published by the government indicated up to 850,000 households who were entitled to receive pension credit in 2019-20 did not claim the benefit.The benefit can be claimed by phone and online, and an online calculator can help pensioners check if they are likely to be eligible and get an estimate of what they may receive.👉 Click to subscribe to the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcasts 👈Controversial change gets the go-aheadOn Tuesday 10 September MPs voted on a motion to cancel the government's cut to the winter fuel allowance.348 MPs voted to approve the winter payment cut and 228 voted to cancel it, meaning it has now gone through.It came after a lengthy debate in the Commons opened by Mel Stride, the shadow work and pensions secretary, who said nine out of 10 pensioners will lose the benefit ""at the most difficult time of year... when the energy price cap is going up by 10%"".""What happened to transparency? What happened to integrity? It went out of the window,"" Mr Stride said.Labour MP Rachel Maskell - who has been outspoken in her opposition to the plan - told the Commons of pensioners ""frightened"" to turn on the lights in case they cannot pay their bills.""It's with my conscience that I cannot vote for these measures,"" she said.Labour's Debbie Abrahams was also critical of the move, saying many of the government's measures to ease costs on households would not be in place for this winter.Earlier, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer faced down critics as he told union members gathered at the TUC conference in Brighton that he ""owes working people the respect of economic stability"" and makes ""no apologies for any of the decisions we've had to take to begin the work of change"".What has the chancellor said about the change?Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the decision to scrap winter fuel payments for some pensioners was a ""difficult"" one she did not want to make.""This level of overspend is not sustainable,"" she said.""Left unchecked, it is a risk to economic stability and, unlike the party opposite, I will never take risks with our country's economic stability.""Ms Reeves said while the government would continue to protect the pension triple lock - the measure to raise state pensions every year by the level of average earnings, inflation or 2.5% - the winter fuel payment would no longer be universal.""Let me be clear, this is not a decision I wanted to make, nor is it the one I expected to make - but these are the necessary and urgent decisions that I must make,"" she said.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerWhat has the response been?Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, warned the targeting of the payments was ""too narrow with the winter we have coming"", adding: ""The energy price cap is likely to rise 10% this October and stay high across the winter, leaving most energy bills nearly double those pre-crisis, at levels unaffordable for millions.""Many pensioners eke out the £100 to £300 winter fuel payments to allow them to keep some heating on through the cold months.""While there's an argument for ending its universality due to tight national finances, it's being squeezed to too narrow a group - just those on benefits and pension credit. Yet again, those just above the thresholds will be hardest hit.""Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeCaroline Abrahams from Age UK said the charity strongly opposes the means-testing of the winter fuel payment.""A big reason for this disastrous outcome is that more than one in three pensioners entitled to pension credit, the qualifying benefit for [winter fuel payment] under this proposal, don't receive it, a proportion that's been roughly constant for many years.""It is well established that pensioners tend to do everything possible to avoid going into debt, so if they are worried about their future energy bills, we know their likely response will be to ration their fuel use and economise by reducing their spending on other essentials.""This proposed policy change is therefore certain to result in more older people experiencing a horrible eating or heating dilemma.""",https://news.sky.com/story/winter-fuel-payment-changes-are-you-still-eligible-13187277

09-09-2024,SkyNews,UK,Anti-social behaviour concerns: Thousands of communities say their fears aren't being taken seriously by authorities,"A loud crash jolts Paul Wheeler into waking up in the middle of the night.As he peers out of his bedroom window, which overlooks the park at the back of his home in a quiet, suburban part of Kent, he sees a shadowy figure setting fire to something.It's a warm summer night, Labour is celebrating its landslide election win. For the first time in 14 years, there is a new government in place, which has made big promises on crime.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerAs the flames rage close to his garden fence, Paul, 46, starts to film the drama unfolding outside his home, while his two children sleep soundly in the next room.""You need to ring 999 right now,"" he tells his wife. ""People are setting light to something right by the gate at the front of the park.""Then there's an explosion and smoke fills the air.For the last four years, gangs of mainly teenagers have caused trouble in the park behind Paul's house, terrorising him and his neighbours. He pleaded with the council to install CCTV but his request was turned down.The next morning, the charred remains of a motorbike lie at the park entrance. The gate is damaged and the ground is covered in debris including bits of wire, nuts and bolts. The flames have turned the leaves of a large tree a rusty brown.Paul's experience mirrors that of thousands of other communities around Britain who say their concerns about anti-social behaviour, which includes anything from vandalism to public drunkenness and noise disturbances, aren't being taken seriously by police and local councils.One million incidents a yearA landmark report by the victims' commissioner for England and Wales, Baroness Newlove, details a failure by those agencies to respond to the one million incidents of anti-social behaviour recorded every year by police.The report finds that two-thirds of people (63%) who reported anti-social behaviour said their problem had not been resolved.The majority, more than 60%, reported it to multiple agencies.And a staggering 70% said they received no support at all.For people like Paul, living with anti-social behaviour has taken a heavy toll on his mental health. ""It makes you fearful,"" he says. ""It gives us massive amounts of anxiety and stress.""His neighbour Jackie Beamiss, 68, has also experienced feelings of despair over the disturbances in the park. Calling and emailing Kent Police, writing to her local MP and the council, are all actions she says she has taken over the past four years.""I'm fed up with nobody listening to us or appreciating how serious it can be,"" says Jackie, who has been dealing with this on top of a breast cancer diagnosis. ""I feel too intimidated to even let my dog out in the back garden.""Neighbourhood Watch coordinator Garry Turner says the message they get back from the police is they need more evidence. ""You can't get more evidence than what has been provided. And we're still not getting the response we deserve,"" he adds.One in three experience or see anti-social behaviourAccording to the Crime Survey for England and Wales, published in March, 35% of people have experienced or witnessed some type of anti-social behaviour.The findings reveal deep-rooted problems in some communities, driven by economic hardship, social fragmentation and the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.Back in Wilmot Park, Paul is still upset by what he witnessed on the night of the fire and thinks the police took too long to respond. It appears to have been an attack on a gate at the park entrance that was installed by the council in 2023.Kent Police told Sky News they are ""aware of local concerns"" and working with Dartford Borough Council to address these issues. They said they attended the incident with the motorbike ""within hours"" but haven't caught those responsible.In a statement, they added: ""We have teams who regularly patrol the area and also have a dedicated beat officer who residents can talk to directly.""A spokesperson for Dartford Borough Council said: ""We fully understand that any anti-social behaviour (ASB) is incredibly frustrating for residents and has a negative impact on the wider community.""In relation to Wilmot Park we will continue to respond to incidents of ASB where we have the evidence and powers to do so, and have also increased our park ranger presence in the park in recent months.""Previous approaches have been too reactive, focusing on punishment rather than prevention, according to Baroness Newlove, whose husband Garry was kicked to death by a gang of youths in 2007, after he confronted them outside the family home in Warrington, Cheshire.""It's been 17 years since Garry's life was taken. It saddens and angers me that anti-social behaviour is still being classed as low level, a misdemeanour.""Victims are forced to jump hurdle after hurdle to get the response they deserve. They have to be taken more seriously.""Despite numerous attempts by successive governments to address the problem, the issue has continued to plague communities.The new government says combating anti-social behaviour is a central focus of its policy agenda.

10-09-2024,SkyNews,UK,Labour won't want to be associated with austerity - but it's creeping into the debate,"The government comfortably won another vote today but, while Starmer has the numbers behind him to withstand opposition - including from his own party - he is under pressure to change his gloomy tune.As many as 52 Labour MPs refused to support the government's plan to axe the winter fuel payment for all but the poorest pensioners, with one outright voting against the policy. It comes just months after the government won a vote to maintain the two-child benefit cap.It's understood that only 12 of those absences were unauthorised, with the government appearing sanguine about the result. Yet, there are more than a few murmurings of discontent.Politics live: Candidate eliminated from race to replace SunakWhile the party was elected on a mandate to ""change Britain"" and ""fix public services,"" it's increasingly being associated with phrases like ""austerity"" and ""benefit cuts.""Taking a leaf out of the coalition government's 2010 playbook, the government is trying to shape a different narrative: that ""difficult decisions"" are the result of the previous government's recklessness.It's not a straightforward sell. The arithmetic might back Sir Keir, but his message won't necessarily wash with a weary public - or with MPs.Many of them laid out their stalls ahead of the vote in a debate that featured a series of impassioned speeches.The most notable came from Labour's own MPs, with the likes of Rachael Maskell and Neil Duncan-Jordan calling for the policy to be delayed, signalling that they would rebel against their own party. Both abstained.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsJon Trickett, the one Labour MP who outright voted against the policy, now awaits his fate. He will have seen how the leadership treated the seven MPs who rebelled against the party's stance on the two-child benefit cap. They all lost the whip.John McDonnell, among that camp of seven MPs, signalled that he would vote against the government again. He said: ""I do regret voting for a motion put forth by [Tories], but I will have to because there's no other mechanism. And I say to my people in back in Hayes: I want to look at them in their face and say, I did the right thing.""He was joined by Zarah Sultana, Richard Burgon, Ian Byrne, and Apsana Begum. Their route back into the Labour Party now looks more uncertain. The remaining two, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Imran Hussain, abstained.While the government comfortably won the vote, the narrative they have tried to cement since winning the election came under strain from opposition MPs. The government argues that the withdrawal of support to all pensioners is necessary to salvage the public finances and fix the economy.It was a line repeated by Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, who sounded a lot like the last Conservative chancellor Jeremy Hunt when she said: ""We must fix the foundations of our economy"" and ""When money is tight"" tough decisions have to be made.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeRead more:State pension to rise by more than £400Sign ups for pension credit doubles Starmer: Cutting fuel payment will stabilise economyIn this battle of competing narratives, the notion was repeatedly challenged.

Can it work? Can the prison system be fixed?Tuesday's cohort of early leavers are those serving sentences of less than five years, and on 22 October it will be the turn of those with sentences of five years or more - but the government insists it won't apply to most serious offenders such as killers, rapists and terrorists.Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the scheme would free up space for 5,500 offenders. The alternative, she told me, would be ""unthinkable"" - judges no longer able to hand down sentences because there is no room to house new offenders.However unpopular, the move is much needed - and it still might not be enough.Prisons in England and Wales are almost full.Official figures for 6 September 2024 showed the total prison population to be 88,521.Useable operational capacity for the system stands at 89,619.But that really is the top end, most prisons are already over-stuffed.As well as ""operational capacity"" you can also measure capacity by ""certified normal accommodation"" (CNA).Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeThis is the number of people that can be held in each prison in safe and decent accommodation. On this measurement 75 of the 122 prisons in England and Wales are at 100% capacity or over.

It has also spent £2.4bn procuring new equipment for Kyiv.The MoD told the NAO the cost of replenishing British stockpiles is set to vastly outweigh the value of the donated equipment, and said it expects to spend £2.71bn up to 2030-31.Read more on Sky News:TV star calls for apology from PMMultiple bodies found on Mont BlancKeep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsIn the report, the MoD said the discrepancy was because the UK is buying newer equipment which in some cases was more advanced than the kit donated to Ukraine.It comes after Defence Secretary John Healey announced last week Operation Interflex would continue throughout the next year.The minister met his European counterparts and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at a defence summit in Germany last week.The NAO investigation did not seek to evaluate the strategic case for supporting Ukraine or reach conclusions on value for money, but was intended only to set out the facts regarding what support was being provided.",https://news.sky.com/story/british-army-constrained-in-ability-to-train-troops-over-ukrainian-soldier-operations-report-says-13212687

29-08-2024,SkyNews,Politics,How would an outdoor smoking ban work – and who would be part of the 'smoke-free generation'? ,"The government has said it is considering banning smoking in pub gardens and other outdoor areas.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer confirmed the proposal is in the works on Thursday, following reports in The Sun.He says the measures are aimed at reducing the 80,000 preventable deaths from smoking in the UK each year.Labour also wants to continue with the previous government's plans to create a 'smoke-free generation' by banning the sale of cigarettes in the future to anyone 14 or under.While details of the new plans are still in the works, here's what we know so far and how the ban might work.How would the outdoor ban work?Smoking has been illegal in enclosed public places and workplaces since 2007 in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland - and since 2006 in Scotland.The current bans do not cover vapes.Breaking the law on smoking in workplaces carries a £200 maximum fine in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - and £50 in Scotland. Businesses can be given penalties of up to £2,500 for failing to enforce the rules.An outdoor ban would likely apply the same rules to most outdoor spaces - including some parks, all pub gardens, outdoor restaurants, sports venues, and areas outside nightclubs and hospitals.Details on all the venues covered by the proposal and what the fines would be are yet to be released.Why has the ban been proposed?When asked to confirm the outdoor ban rumours, the prime minister said: ""My starting point on this is to remind everyone that over 80,000 people lose their lives every year to smoking, that's a preventable death, it's a huge burden on the NHS and of course to the taxpayer"".He promised to ""take decisions in this space"" to ""reduce the burden on the NHS and the taxpayer"".Smoking is the UK's biggest preventable killer, causing around one in four cancer deaths and leading to 64,000 deaths per year in England, according to Dr Javed Khan's 2022 review into making smoking obsolete.It is hoped the plans will prevent tens of thousands of deaths and save the NHS billions of pounds.Will it work?Hospitality businesses are sceptical the plans are enforceable, however.Reem Ibrahim, acting director of communications at the Institute of Economic Affairs thinktank, said they would be ""another nail in the coffin for the pub industry"".""Pubs and other private venues should be able to determine their own outdoor smoking rules - just as they should be allowed to decide whether to play music, serve food or show football on TV,"" he added.Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality echoed his concerns, saying the plans will also affect hotels, cafes, and restaurants.She pointed to the number of pub closures after the indoor smoking bans of 2006 and 2007 - and called for businesses to be consulted before any measures are implemented.What about 14s and under?Rishi Sunak's Conservative government proposed to ban anyone who was born on or after 1 January 2009 from buying cigarette or tobacco products.This would effectively raise the legal age for buying cigarettes in England by one year every year, until it applies to the whole population.Labour has said it will continue with the plans, laying out the Tobacco and Vapes Bill in the King's Speech in July.This will also include limits on the sale and marketing of vapes - but exact details have not been published yet.As with previous plans, smoking would not be criminalised. Instead, the phased approach means those who are already old enough to buy cigarettes will be able to carry on doing so.Older people, however, may have to carry ID if they want to buy cigarettes when the law changes.Will the under-14 ban stop young people smoking?There is ""excellent evidence"" increasing the legal age for buying tobacco from 16 to 18 in the UK ""substantially reduced smoking prevalence"", according to Jamie Brown, professor of behavioural science at University College London (UCL).""This provides good reason to expect this measure to have a similar impact,"" he said.Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said the ban was ""creeping prohibition"" and will not work.""Anyone who wants to smoke will buy tobacco abroad or from illicit sources,"" he said.Are there any similar bans around the world?New Zealand passed a similar ban, but it was repealed by the country's new coalition government before it came into force.How much of the population will be affected?In 2022, 12.9% of the adult UK population (6.4 million people) were smokers, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).As for the 'smoke-free generation', 21% of the UK population is currently not allowed to buy cigarettes due to their age.But assuming the age of sale rises to 19 in 2027, and increases by one year every year after that, the proportion of the population below the age of sale will reach 30% in 2035, 40% in 2044 and 50% in 2053.The ban only covers England - what about the other UK nations?The legal smoking age is a devolved issue, so the governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland set their own laws around it.Depending on what laws the other nations adopt, there could be a situation where is it illegal for someone to buy cigarettes or smoke in pub gardens in England, but legal across the border.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsWhat are the next steps?In the King's Speech at the opening of the new parliament, Labour said the Tobacco and Vapes Bill would be introduced by the end of this year.As with all legislation, it will need to be approved in the House of Commons and the House of Lords before being written into law.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeIf the government wants to stop people smoking, why not just ban cigarettes?Banning tobacco outright would not immediately stop the UK's 6.4 million smokers from smoking, Dr Sarah Jackson from UCL explains.""Because cigarettes are so highly addictive, many people would be unable or unwilling to do so, and a ban would likely drive demand towards the illicit market,"" she said.""Gradually increasing the age of sale over time... will be helpful in discouraging young people from taking up smoking in the first place.""What about vaping?This government and the previous one have both vowed to crack down on vaping among children.Vaping is ""rightly"" used as a tool to quit smoking, a spokesperson said, but they added: ""The health advice is clear, if you don't smoke, don't vape and children should never vape"".The name of the new bill reveals limits will be imposed on e-cigarettes.This could mean flavours being restricted and tighter regulations on packaging and point-of-sale displays.The ONS reported a rise in vaping among young people, with 15.5% of 16 to 24-year-olds reporting vaping daily or on occasion in 2022, up from 11.1% in 2021.",https://news.sky.com/story/how-would-an-outdoor-smoking-ban-work-and-who-would-be-part-of-the-smoke-free-generation-12977337
10-09-2024,SkyNews,Politics,Labour won't want to be associated with austerity - but it's creeping into the debate,"The government comfortably won another vote today but, while Starmer has the numbers behind him to withstand opposition - including from his own party - he is under pressure to change his gloomy tune.As many as 52 Labour MPs refused to support the government's plan to axe the winter fuel payment for all but the poorest pensioners, with one outright voting against the policy.

Yet, there are more than a few murmurings of discontent.Politics live: Candidate eliminated from race to replace SunakWhile the party was elected on a mandate to ""change Britain"" and ""fix public services,"" it's increasingly being associated with phrases like ""austerity"" and ""benefit cuts.""Taking a leaf out of the coalition government's 2010 playbook, the government is trying to shape a different narrative: that ""difficult decisions"" are the result of the previous government's recklessness.It's not a straightforward sell. The arithmetic might back Sir Keir, but his message won't necessarily wash with a weary public - or with MPs.Many of them laid out their stalls ahead of the vote in a debate that featured a series of impassioned speeches.The most notable came from Labour's own MPs, with the likes of Rachael Maskell and Neil Duncan-Jordan calling for the policy to be delayed, signalling that they would rebel against their own party. Both abstained.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsJon Trickett, the one Labour MP who outright voted against the policy, now awaits his fate. He will have seen how the leadership treated the seven MPs who rebelled against the party's stance on the two-child benefit cap. They all lost the whip.John McDonnell, among that camp of seven MPs, signalled that he would vote against the government again. He said: ""I do regret voting for a motion put forth by [Tories], but I will have to because there's no other mechanism. And I say to my people in back in Hayes: I want to look at them in their face and say, I did the right thing.""He was joined by Zarah Sultana, Richard Burgon, Ian Byrne, and Apsana Begum. Their route back into the Labour Party now looks more uncertain. The remaining two, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Imran Hussain, abstained.While the government comfortably won the vote, the narrative they have tried to cement since winning the election came under strain from opposition MPs. The government argues that the withdrawal of support to all pensioners is necessary to salvage the public finances and fix the economy.It was a line repeated by Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, who sounded a lot like the last Conservative chancellor Jeremy Hunt when she said: ""We must fix the foundations of our economy"" and ""When money is tight"" tough decisions have to be made.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeRead more:State pension to rise by more than £400Sign ups for pension credit doubles Starmer: Cutting fuel payment will stabilise economyIn this battle of competing narratives, the notion was repeatedly challenged.

10-09-2024,SkyNews,Politics,Early release of thousands of prisoners is deeply unpopular - so will it work?,"Today's release is the chance for hundreds of prisoners to turn their lives around - or to go back to their old ways.It's also crunch time to turn around the woeful situation in our overcrowded jails that has led to this decision. Can it work? Can the prison system be fixed?Tuesday's cohort of early leavers are those serving sentences of less than five years, and on 22 October it will be the turn of those with sentences of five years or more - but the government insists it won't apply to most serious offenders such as killers, rapists and terrorists.Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the scheme would free up space for 5,500 offenders. The alternative, she told me, would be ""unthinkable"" - judges no longer able to hand down sentences because there is no room to house new offenders.However unpopular, the move is much needed - and it still might not be enough.Prisons in England and Wales are almost full.Official figures for 6 September 2024 showed the total prison population to be 88,521.Useable operational capacity for the system stands at 89,619.But that really is the top end, most prisons are already over-stuffed.As well as ""operational capacity"" you can also measure capacity by ""certified normal accommodation"" (CNA).Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeThis is the number of people that can be held in each prison in safe and decent accommodation. On this measurement 75 of the 122 prisons in England and Wales are at 100% capacity or over. The most packed is Durham at 172% capacity.All this has contributed to the ""devastating picture"" described in today's annual report by the chief inspector of prisons Charlie Taylor finding a surge in violence, drug use and self-harm along with a failure to rehabilitate prisoners.👉 Click to subscribe to the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcasts 👈All leading to Mr Taylor's assertion that many prisoners are in ""a revolving door"", with untreated mental health and drug problems.Often with nowhere to live when they come out, they re-offend - sometimes to feed a drug habit they acquired in prison.Mr Taylor told Sky News: ""That of course, just creates more victims of crime, more mayhem in communities and a prison population that is now almost unmanageable.""Read more:Prisoners welcome early releaseEarly release inmates could be housed in hotelsOne prisoner coming out on early release this morning even admitted to us there was a ""99% chance"" he will get recalled due to his bail conditions, while another said they were released to become homeless.So, losing 5,500 prisoners will give breathing space - but will still leave prisons incredibly stretched, under-resourced and at current re-offending rates, about 1,375 of the released inmates will be back soon.According to the Institute for Government, the growth in the population has been driven by longer sentences, with average custodial sentences now 25% longer than they were in 2012. Those on remand and those recalled to prison have also more recently caused the population to rise rapidly.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsThe Institute for Government says that because of the growing backlog in the courts, the number of people on remand has risen 84% since 2019 and now accounts for almost 20% of the total prison population.Equally the number of people released on parole and then recalled is up 72% since 2019.Speaking to Ms Mahmood yesterday, I got no sense that she thinks prisoners should get shorter sentences.So to fix all these problems long-term, the courts need speeding up, the prison and probation service needs investment and more prisons need to be built - all of which the government promises to do, but with what money?And even with investment - it will take time.",https://news.sky.com/story/early-release-of-thousands-of-prisoners-is-deeply-unpopular-so-will-it-work-13212406

He did take six questions after his speech, but he left the stage swiftly after that.In fairness, the prime minister had pressing business in parliament, where his pesky backbenchers were still - as he left Brighton - threatening a rebellion on winter fuel payments.Politics latest: MPs debate cut to winter fuel paymentsBut in the 40 minutes he was on the platform, Sir Keir delivered a predictably tough message to the unions: don't expect big pay rises under a Labour government.His Tory opponents would claim it's a bit late for that message since the government has already offered inflation-busting pay rises to train drivers and junior doctors.Given his tough tone, his reception here was never going to reach rock star proportions. And - harsh but fair - Sir Keir is never going to be a rock star politician like Sir Tony, Boris Johnson or Barack Obama.But he did receive a standing ovation after his speech and Q&A, though not from everyone in the hall - and there were a few empty seats.And twice during his speech, a lone female heckler shouted: ""Tax the rich!"" And no, it wasn't Unite general secretary Sharon Graham, who'd made that demand in a fiery conference speech the previous day.The key phrases in Sir Keir's warning on pay were phrases like ""I have to level with you"", ""this will take a while"", ""tough decisions"" and ""I owe you that candour"".Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsBut the phrase that really stood out in the speech was ""working people"". He said it no fewer than 19 times. The message here was that despite all the accusations of austerity measures in the short term, the government is on the side of working people.When it came to questions, the only challenging one of the six was on why Labour had not axed George Osborne's two-child benefit cap. He talked about tackling child poverty, but didn't give a definitive answer.He must have been relieved that there was no question on winter fuel payments, although the suspicion at TUC conferences has always been that questions from the floor to a Labour leader are heavily vetted by the general secretary and his inner circle.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerRead more:MPs to vote on cutting winter fuel paymentVote will test Sir Keir's authoritySir Keir had, of course, come to Brighton with good news and bad news.

10-09-2024,SkyNews,World,Tim Walz: The arrest that changed his life - and how it shaped his political career,"""You have responsibilities to others. You can't afford to make foolish decisions.""Those are the words Tim Walz's wife Gwen said to him after he was arrested for drink-driving at the age of 31.Now Kamala Harris's vice president nominee, Mr Walz looks back on this as a defining incident in his life, describing it as a ""life-changing"" moment.Mr Walz, now 60 and running to be the Democratic vice president, offered to resign from his teaching job and permanently swapped alcohol for Diet Mountain Dew, he told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis while running for governor of Minnesota in 2018.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player23 September 1995Tim Walz was working as a geography teacher and football coach at a high school in Nebraska when he was stopped by police on 23 September 1995.He had not long got his teaching degree and met his wife of a year Gwen, who was also a teacher from Minnesota.He had been watching college football with some friends when he was pulled over going 96mph in a 55mph zone.According to court documents, the state police officer smelled alcohol on his breath and Mr Walz failed initial breath tests.He was taken to a nearby hospital for a blood test and booked into Dawes County Jail.Court documents show he had 0.128% alcohol in his blood, which was over the legal limit of 0.1%.His lawyer claimed Mr Walz initially thought the police car was chasing him because it came up so quickly behind him and didn't turn its lights on.Ultimately Mr Walz took a plea deal and the charge was reduced to reckless driving. He lost his licence and was fined $200 (£152).'Real disappointed in himself'When the case came to court in March 1996, Mr Walz's defence lawyer said that as a high school teacher and role model to his students, he felt ""terrible"" and was ""real disappointed, I guess, in himself"".The arrest saw him give up his coaching position - and even offer his resignation to his principal because he ""felt so bad"".His boss convinced him to stay, however, so instead Mr Walz used the experience to warn his pupils of the dangers of drink-driving.He told the courtroom: ""It's just a dangerous situation. Not just to myself, but to others who aren't even involved with it.""Tim Walz's drink-driving arrest re-emerged in the media soon after Kamala Harris announced he was going to be her running mate this year.But there was some confusion over false claims he wasn't over the limit.When he was running for Congress in 2006, his campaign spokesperson told a local news outlet in Minnesota he was not drunk that night in 1995.She said of the decision to reduce the charge to reckless driving: ""The DUI charge was dropped for a reason: It wasn't true.""She claimed that hearing loss he suffered while with his National Guard artillery unit may have been the reason he failed sobriety tests.There were also false reports given by his team that he had been allowed to drive himself to the police station – where he was later allowed to leave of his own accord.Court documents have since shown no mention of any hearing issues – and that he was driven to Dawes County Jail by officers.Speaking to his local newspaper in the run-up to his 2018 election as governor, Mr Walz reflected on how his run-in with the law changed his perspective.His father, a school administrator, died when he was 19.In an interview, he said it left him feeling as though his life had been ""ripped up"" and, throwing caution to the wind, saw him take unnecessary risks.He had joined the National Guard two years before, but instead of pursuing a military career, he went to China. It was only the second time ever he had got on a plane. He spent a year teaching there, which coincided with the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.On his return to the US he moved from state to state - Nebraska to Texas to Arkansas - where he ended up working in a factory that made beds for tanning salons.Bridging dividesHe returned to Nebraska, took up his first US teaching post and a full-time job with the National Guard, with football coaching on the side.Before long he started dating his wife, whom he married in 1994. They have two children - daughter Hope who was born in 2001 and son Gus born in 2006.After the couple moved back to Minnesota, Mr Walz swapped the National Guard, where he had progressed to command sergeant major by the time he left in 2005, with politics.That year he ran for Congress in the Republican-leaning 1st district of Minnesota.Read moreWho is Tim Walz?Walz accused of lying about fertility treatmentAnalysis: Why Harris picked WalzDuring the campaign, he established himself as someone who could build bridges - in a traditionally Democrat state surrounded by the Republican rural heartlands of Wisconsin and Michigan.He gave an example of when he was still a teacher in 1999 - and one of his pupils wanted to start a gay-straight alliance - just three years after President Bill Clinton had signed the Defence of Marriage Act, effectively banning same-sex marriage.In his National Guard days, he had seen LGBT people threatened with discharge, and at school, pupils bullied by their peers for their sexuality.Seeing the potential to cut through to its critics, Mr Walz became the group's faculty adviser.He told a newspaper interview: ""It really needed to be the football coach, who was the soldier and was straight and was married.""After beating the Republican incumbent to take his House seat in 2007, he stayed there for 12 years, before successfully running for governor in 2018.When Kamala Harris announced him as her VP pick this year, she said: ""As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he's delivered for working families like his.""",https://news.sky.com/story/tim-walz-the-arrest-that-changed-his-life-and-how-it-shaped-his-political-career-13208883
10-09-2024,SkyNews,World,JD Vance: How vice-presidential candidate used his 'hillbilly' background to catapult himself to the top of US politics,"When JD Vance says he came from nothing, he really means it.There are plenty of clichés that seemingly encapsulate how a child born in poverty can go on to become a vice presidential candidate by the age of 39; it's almost the perfect example of the ""American Dream"".But Donald Trump's running mate isn't in this position in spite of his challenging upbringing - in many ways, he's there because of it.This is how JD Vance took his experiences as a self-proclaimed hillbilly and used them to write a bestselling book and propel himself to the top of politics.Hillbilly ElegyIn his 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy, Mr Vance, born into an impoverished household in southern Ohio, shares stories about his chaotic family life and about communities that had declined and seemed to lose hope.He details his own journey and how he navigated his dysfunctional family.Trump v Harris: How body language spoke as loudly as the wordsWhere did Donald Trump's pet-eating claims come from?Aggression, disrespect and insult - a confrontation that Trump has rarely facedThere's his grandmother, who he refers to as Mamaw, who helped raise him on ""tough love"" - and once doused his Papaw with gasoline and dropped a lit match to punish him for being unfaithful. He escaped with minor burns.Then there is his mother, who struggled to care for him as she battled a drug addiction and at one point forced him to provide a urine sample for her drug test.He analyses his experiences growing up in Ohio to reflect on why the working-class American region of Appalachia, which consists of 13 states from southern New York to northern Mississippi, changed from reliably Democratic to reliably Republican.He does this not just by looking at his family, but also at the troubled community around him. He highlights the impact the steel industry's struggles in the 1970s had on his city, along with the opioid crisis which plagued the country.""It is in Greater Appalachia where the fortunes of working-class whites seem dimmest. From low social mobility to poverty to divorce and drug addiction, my home is a hub of misery,"" he writes in the introduction.He goes on to say he identifies with the ""millions of working-class Americans who have no college degree"".""To these folks, poverty is the family tradition - their ancestors were day labourers in the southern slave economy, share-croppers after that, and machinists and millworkers during more recent times.""Americans call them hillbillies, rednecks or white trash. I call them neighbours, friends and family.""The book was written by Mr Vance in his late 20s/early 30s. By that point, he had gone on to serve in the Marine Corps, graduate from Yale Law School where he met his wife Usha, and become a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley.Critical acclaim - and some critiquesTo many liberal Americans struggling to understand why a wealthy New York businessman like Donald Trump was appealing to so many struggling working-class voters in the 2016 US election, the book was something of a revelation.And conservatives were also widely keen on the book, which criticised the welfare system and what Vance saw as ""too many young men immune to hard work"".Read more:Your ultimate guide to the US electionHow Vance defends his 'childless cat ladies' remarksVladimir Putin reveals who he wants to win US electionIt was called ""one of the six best books to help understand Trump's win"", by The New York Times and given rave reviews by the likes of The Wall Street Journal and The Economist.But it also garnered plenty of criticism, with some - particularly across Appalachia - faulting it as a stereotypical and misleading portrait of the region and of poverty in the US, while ignoring the role of racism in politics.National talk shows and columnists - whether praising the book or finding fault with it - were giving it plenty of publicity.Memoir sells millionsThe book quickly hit best-seller lists and sold more than three million copies before Mr Trump chose him for the Republican ticket, according to its publishers HarperCollins.The memoir's sales were boosted in 2020 after it was made into a Netflix film directed by Ron Howard and starring Amy Adams as Mr Vance's mum Bev and Glenn Close as his grandmother.Mr Vance himself was played by Gabriel Basso, while Owen Asztalos played a younger version of him in flashbacks.And as Mr Vance moved away from capital ventures and into politics, his stock continued to rise.He became a popular political commentator on TV and announced he was running to become the state of Ohio's senator in 2022. He was subsequently elected and sworn into office in January 2023.Once a 'never Trumper'It's clear to see Mr Vance always understood the former president's appeal for voters.""He communicates in a way that is very relatable to a lot of people; it's one of the things that both parties frankly have been increasingly bad at, which is connecting to voters in an emotional and kind of visceral way, and I think Trump does that,"" he said in August 2016 - months before Mr Trump was elected.""And he is tapping into a substantive concern that people have... the sense America's best days are behind it and the future doesn't hold a whole lot of promise.""While he may have understood him, Mr Vance was actually highly critical of Mr Trump in 2016.He once described himself as a ""never Trumper"" and - after his election win - labelled the then-president an ""idiot"" and said he could be ""America's Hitler"".""I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole like Nixon who wouldn't be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he's America's Hitler,"" Mr Vance wrote privately to an associate on Facebook in 2016.When his Hitler comment was first reported, in 2022, a spokesperson did not dispute it, but said it no longer represented Vance's views.Vance's Trump U-turnMr Vance of course changed his mind.The book itself may have even played a big role in that process, as he is said to have grown close with Donald Trump Jr because he was a big fan of the memoir.The two became friends and by the time Mr Vance met Mr Trump in 2021, he had reversed his opinion, citing his accomplishments as president.By the time Mr Vance ran for the Senate in 2022 his demonstrations of loyalty - which included downplaying the January 6 Capitol riots - were sufficient to score Mr Trump's coveted endorsement.Mr Trump's support helped put him over the top in a competitive primary.In interviews Mr Vance has said there was no 'eureka' moment that changed his mind on Mr Trump. Instead, he claimed to have gradually realised that his opposition to Mr Trump was rooted in style over substance.Some have criticised him for the shift as he continues to distance himself from some of his old comments. Not only that - but from his memoir.He recently told The New York Times he had distanced himself from Hillbilly Elegy in order not to ""wake up in 10 years and really hate everything that I've become.""Fast-forward to now and Mr Vance is campaigning alongside Mr Trump ahead of what promises to be a dramatic election day on 5 November.His memoir sales will be in Mr Vance's peripheral at this late stage in the race - but it's worth noting more than 650,000 copies were bought in the 10 days after Mr Trump announced him as running mate.",https://news.sky.com/story/jd-vance-how-vice-presidential-candidate-used-his-hillbilly-background-to-catapult-himself-to-the-top-of-us-politics-13210612

It would be really terrible if we couldn't. And I don't just speak for myself, I speak for everyone here.""Jose Valdivia, the Nicaraguan manager of the shelter, is even clearer.""Everybody, since the last election, we all wanted the Democrats to win, right?

10-09-2024,SkyNews,World,Risk-averse Anthony Blinken is verging on the delusional,"The use of sanctions failed to deter Russia from invading Ukraine and failed to persuade Moscow to end it - and yet despite one of the most dramatic escalations in this conflict so far, the West is just issuing more of them, and limited ones at that.This as the war is turning in Russia's favour again, though you wouldn't believe it from the conduct of US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken during his visit to London.Russian forces are closing in on Pokrovsk, a key transport hub. Losing it could lose Ukraine the entire Donetz region.That is one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's key war aims.But asked by Sky's Yalda Hakim about the possibility of the city falling, America's top diplomat gave an answer that was a study in looking on the bright side.

That is a statement of fact.And yet both Messrs Blinken and Lammy insist the deal is 90% done.It was this answer, though, that will strike observers in the Middle East as the most disingenuous.""In the democratic system, leaders make decisions, and they have to be responsive to their people, and they have to be responsive to the interests of their country.

That is a statement of fact.And yet both Messrs Blinken and Lammy insist the deal is 90% done.It was this answer, though, that will strike observers in the Middle East as the most disingenuous.""In the democratic system, leaders make decisions, and they have to be responsive to their people, and they have to be responsive to the interests of their country.

The defendant in that case, charged with animal cruelty, has no known connection to Haiti, according to The Canton Repository newspaper.Had Trump made the claims before?Not directly, but Republicans including Mr Vance had stoked the rumours ahead of the debate.The official X account for the Republicans on the House judiciary committee posted an AI-generated image of Mr Trump with his arms around a duck and cat with the caption: ""Protect our ducks and kittens in Ohio!""Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeTed Cruz, the Republican senator from Texas, shared a photo of two cats hugging with the caption: ""Please vote for Trump so Haitian immigrants don't eat us.""On Monday Mr Vance tweeted saying: ""In the last several weeks, my office has received many inquiries from actual residents of Springfield who've said their neighbours' pets or local wildlife were abducted by Haitian migrants.""It's possible, of course, that all of these rumours will turn out to be false.""",https://news.sky.com/story/where-did-donald-trumps-pet-eating-claims-come-from-13212808

13-02-2024,SkyNews,Israel-Hamas War,What is the two-state solution for Israel and Palestinians?,"The two-state solution has long been proposed as the best hope for peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.It would see an independent Palestinian state established alongside the existing one of Israel - giving both peoples their own territory.It is the official position of the UK, US, the United Nations, and until now, Israel.On 18 January in a televised address, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: ""In any future arrangement.... Israel needs security control over all territory west of the Jordan River.""It comes after several other Israeli politicians explicitly stated they no longer endorse a two-state solution.Here, we look at some of the key obstacles.What would it look like - and who would live where?The biggest obstacle to a two-state solution is deciding what the borders of a potential Palestinian state would be.Many believe they should be the same ones that existed before the 1967 Six-Day War, which saw Israel occupy East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza.Since then, increasing numbers of Israeli settlements have been established inside the West Bank, with around 600,000 Israelis now living there and in Occupied East Jerusalem.Although these settlements are considered illegal under international law, their existence makes the territory increasingly difficult to designate as Palestinian.Read more:The deep roots of the Israeli-Palestinian conflictCould Hezbollah-Israel clashes lead to a wider war?How did this war happen?The creation of Israel and the subsequent Arab-Israeli war of 1948 saw many Palestinians forced from their homes, in what is known as the Nakba, or ""catastrophe"" in English.As such, the UN gave around 750,000 people refugee status, defined as people ""whose normal place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948, and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict"".But under the same criteria, 5.9 million Palestinians - who live in the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, and in camps across Jordan, Lebanon and Syria - now qualify, and many would want to return to their homeland.There would not be space for this increased number of people inside the occupied territories, meaning some would have to be resettled in Israeli territory, which Israel is unlikely to tolerate.JerusalemThere are particular border difficulties with Jerusalem.Both sides claim the ancient city as their capital. This is because of its huge historical and religious significance for both Israelis and Palestinians and the fact it is home to several holy sites in Judaism, Islam, and Christianity.For example, the walled Old City hosts both The Temple Mount - Judaism's holiest site - and Al Aqsa Mosque, the third most important location in Islam behind Mecca and Medina, where Muslims believe the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven.In 2023, there were violent clashes between Israeli police and Palestinian worshippers there.The Israeli government claims Jerusalem is their ""undivided capital"", and it is the seat of the Israeli government and parliament (Knesset), but East Jerusalem is widely considered an occupied Palestinian territory.In theory, a two-state solution would officially recognise both East Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital and a western part of the city for the Israelis.Who supports it - and what has Israel said?Previously, Israel's endorsement was conditional on Palestinian groups demilitarising - as it sees Hamas and others as an existential threat.Fatah and the governing Palestinian Authority in the West Bank support the solution, providing they are allowed to police themselves.Hamas, which controls Gaza, has committed itself to the destruction of Israel. However, in a revised charter published in 2017, it said it would accept a Palestinian state along the 1967 borders.The lack of consensus on the Palestinian side makes the solution difficult - and the admission of Israeli officials that they are no longer committed to it near impossible.The US has recently reiterated the two-state solution is the best way to ensure Israel's security, unify moderate Arab countries in the region, and isolate Iran.It has also called for the Palestinian Authority to be ""revitalised"" and able to return to Gaza having been ousted in 2007.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerBut Mr Netanyahu said in his recent address that Israel ""will not settle for anything short of absolute victory"" and that Israeli control over all territory west of the Jordan River is a ""necessary condition"" when the current conflict ends.""I tell this truth to our American friends and I also stopped the attempt to impose a reality on us that would harm Israel's security,"" he said.Before now, he has been quoted by Israel's national broadcaster, saying Palestinian hopes of a sovereign state ""must be eliminated"".Previously Israeli communications minister Shlomo Karhi wrote on X: ""There will be no Palestinian state here.""And Israeli-UK ambassador Tzipi Hotovely told Sky News the country does ""absolutely not"" endorse a Palestinian state, adding: ""Israel knows today, and the world should know now that the Palestinians never wanted to have a state next to Israel.""They want to have a state from the river to the sea. They are saying it loud and clear. It's now two months after the war started. The Palestinian Authority didn't condemn this massacre (7 October). It's such a big problem.""Meanwhile, although the UN and international community have widely condemned the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and consider them a major barrier to peace, little has been done to deter Israel.Israel disagrees and cites historical and biblical ties to the land.It is widely considered to hold a power advantage over the Palestinians, economically and in terms of its military resources.It has benefited from the strong and consistent support of the US, from which it has been the largest cumulative recipient of US foreign aid since the Second World War.But that support has been on the basis that both sides were working towards a two-state solution, with many left wondering if that will now change.When was there more hope?Hope for the two-state solution peaked in the early 1990s, when the US facilitated the signing of the Oslo Accords under the presidency of Bill Clinton.Famously, then Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian Liberation Organisation chairman Yasser Arafat shook hands on the lawn of the White House.The Oslo Accords saw Israel formally acknowledge the PLO as representative of the Palestinians, and in return the group renounced violence.The two sides agreed on the formation of a Palestinian Authority, which would govern the West Bank and Gaza for a five-year period.Mr Rabin was assassinated by a young Jewish nationalist two years later, which many argue saw hopes of the two-state solution diminish.Since then, various factors have further reduced the chances of the two sides agreeing on a peaceful resolution.These include: increased Jewish settlements in the West Bank; Donald Trump's presidency and his relocation of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem; the most right-wing Israeli government in the country's history; and this year's Hamas attack and the ensuing war.",https://news.sky.com/story/israel-hamas-war-what-is-the-two-state-solution-12985473

And for good reason.There has been a sense building for months now among Israelis that something must give. The new forever war being waged in their name shows no end in sight and it is time for a reckoning.Middle East latest: General strike called in Israel as pressure grows on NetanyahuThere is a consensus forming among Israel's commentators and opinion formers across the political spectrum that the obstacle to a deal bringing home the hostages is the prime minister.It is no longer just those observers on the left blaming him. The ceasefire deal being pushed by the US is on life support because Mr Netanyahu shifted his position at the 11th hour of negotiations and made new demands.His own senior negotiators were so frustrated by his vacillation they leaked evidence of it to the press.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsHamas have played fast and loose too, not least sending a suicide bomber to Tel Aviv at the height of negotiations.But diplomats close to the negotiations say there is little doubt that were it not for Mr Netanyahu's tactics an agreement would have been made and the hostages, or many of them, would be coming home.Read more:Satellite evidence suggests Israel is building long-term presence in GazaHamas commander killed in West Bank, Israeli military saysPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerA reckoning is of course coming.

29-08-2024,SkyNews,Israel-Hamas War,"Five killed inside Tulkarm mosque, IDF says, as 'concerning' Israeli operations continue in West Bank","Israel's military says it has killed five Palestinian troops inside a mosque in Tulkarm, in the West Bank, as it continues to carry out raids in the occupied territory.Overnight, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said they had killed five militants, including a well-known local commander, in the fighting at the mosque.Hundreds of Israeli troops - backed by helicopters, drones and armoured personnel carriers - were sent into the West Bank in the early hours of Wednesday.They targeted Tulkarm, as well as the West Bank city of Jenin and areas in the Jordan Valley.There was no immediate Palestinian confirmation of the death of Mohammed Jaber, known as Abu Shujaa, in the attack at the Tulkarm mosque.Jaber, a commander in the Islamic Jihad militant group in the Nur Shams refugee camp on the outskirts of Tulkarm, was killed along with four others in a shootout with Israeli forces early on Thursday, after they hid inside the mosque, according to Israeli authorities.Jaber is linked to numerous attacks on Israelis, including a deadly shooting in June.He was reported to have been killed earlier this year before he made a surprise appearance at the funeral of other militants where he received a hero's welcome.Another fighter was arrested in Tulkarm, the IDF said, adding a member of their paramilitary Border Police was wounded in the operation.Israeli military operations in the West Bank are said to be ongoing.In Jenin, bulldozers edged along empty streets on Thursday. Drones could be heard overhead while Israeli troops remained stationed in front of the city's main hospital, searching ambulances.There was also a complete network outage at Jawwal, one of the two main telecommunications companies in the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank.Read more:Israeli strikes in the West Bank kill at least 10Hostage rescued in operationWhy danger of all-out war lies ahead in Middle EastBe the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeMeanwhile, despite ongoing efforts and previous optimism, talks are ongoing over a ceasefire in Gaza.An overnight strike in Gaza City left a number of Palestinians, including at least one child, injured.A total of 40,602 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its military response there after the 7 October attacks, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there.

Ambulances continually drove past us, in both directions.The ones trying to reach Jenin's main hospital were stopped and searched to check they were transporting wanted militants. Many were refused access.It felt quieter than previous IDF raids I've covered in Jenin. There were a few bursts of gunfire, and a drone circling constantly overhead, but otherwise pretty quiet.That could be misleading. Israeli military officials tell me the operation could last a while longer yet and spread to other towns in the West Bank.Israel says it is determined to smash terrorist cells operating there, but they've been carrying out raids, almost constantly, and still find the need to do so.The underlying issues are much deeper and more complex - more civilian bodies could only make an already dire situation worse.Images from a morgue in Tubas show a number of dead from the latest West Bank attacks as it appeared the Israeli military was operating in a number of cities in the territory.The armed wings of Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and Fatah said in separate statements their gunmen were fighting Israeli forces in the three West Bank areas.Clashes with the Israeli military in the West Bank have risen sharply since the 7 October attacks and subsequent invasion of Gaza, while Israeli settlers have also launched frequent vigilante-style attacks on Palestinian communities.Israel described the overnight operation as a ""counter-terrorism"" strike, and posting on X, minister for foreign affairs Israel Katz said: ""The IDF has been operating with intensity since last night in the refugee camps of Jenin and Tulkarm to thwart Islamic-Iranian terrorist infrastructures that have been established there.""He accused Iran of working to set up an ""eastern terrorist front"".Mr Katz added: ""This is a full-fledged war, and we must win it.""Five killed in Monday airstrikeSeparately, the IDF said it had ""eliminated five terrorists"" operating in the area of Nur Shams, also in the West Bank, on Monday.Among those dead, they named Jibril Jasan Ismail, who they said was released as part of ""the agreement in November 2023"" - the same time Israel and Hamas conducted a large-scale hostage swap.""Also eliminated were the terrorists Mohanad Qarawi and Muhammad Yussef ... and the terrorist Adnan Jaber,"" the IDF added.Thousands of Palestinians have been arrested in recent military raids in the West Bank, and at least 637 have been killed since the 7 October attacks, according to Palestinian health ministry figures.Many of them are armed fighters but others are stone-throwing youths or uninvolved civilians.At least 30 Israelis have been killed in attacks in Jerusalem and the West Bank during the same period, according to Israeli tallies.Middle East correspondentThe IDF launched its latest military assault overnight in the West Bank on Tuesday. It is focused on the towns of Tulkarm and Jenin although other operations are ongoing elsewhere in the West Bank.Israeli officials say they are acting against attempts by Iran to smuggle weapons and explosives into the West Bank and encourage terror attacks against Israelis.The raids are not targeted at any specific militant group, although elements of Hamas and Islamic Jihad are one focus.The IDF has used drones to strike targets and there are reports of helicopter gunships circling above Jenin. Roads in and out have been shut off and access to hospitals is blocked.Violence in the West Bank, both attacks against Israelis but also IDF raids, has been on the rise since the start of 2023 and has increased further since 7 October.Israel says more than 150 attacks have originated from the West Bank in the past eleven months.A failed suicide bomb in Tel Aviv two weeks ago, which killed the attacker when it exploded in his rucksack and injured one other, is a dangerous development and has caused extreme concern in security circles.It's unclear how long this operation will last, the IDF is not putting a duration on it, nor are they saying how many soldiers are involved. But despite regular raids, sometimes daily, this is clearly one of the bigger operations for some time.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsAt least 16 killed in Khan YounisAt least 16 more people have been killed in Israeli strikes within Gaza, Palestinian officials also said on Wednesday.Five women and three children were among the dead in the southern city of Khan Younis.Those killed include a brother and sister, and their relative, who died in their home in the east of the city, the Nasser Hospital said.Meanwhile, in central Gaza, an Israeli airstrike late on Tuesday killed local journalist Mohamed Abdrabu and his sister.Read more from Sky News:Israeli hostage rescued in 'miraculous' operationWhy danger of all-out war still lies aheadCeasefire talks ongoingThe latest round of Israeli attacks comes as the US, Egypt, and Qatar continue to try to mediate a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.Despite recent optimism, including US President Joe Biden saying they were ""closer than we've ever been"" to a deal, a number of obstacles remain.One sticking point is the ongoing presence of Israeli forces in Gaza, Sky News' Middle East correspondent Alistair Bunkall said.Israel wants to keep forces in the enclave for security and strategic reasons.This includes preventing Hamas from rearming using routes such as the Philadelphi corridor - the border between Gaza and Egypt - which was used by the militant group for many years.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeA total of 40,534 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its military response there after the 7 October attacks, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there.

It's the vote of the people now. It's not tied up in the federal government.

10-09-2024,SkyNews,US,Kamala Harris: The high school conversation that drove her to where she is today,"Kamala Harris was a prosecutor for far longer than she's been a politician.Harris's lengthy career in law started in 1990 when she became a deputy district attorney specialising in prosecuting child sexual assault offenders.It ran until 2017 when she was overseeing the largest state justice department in the country as attorney general of California.She says what drove her - and what still drives her - is ""a very strong sense of responsibility to protect those who are vulnerable"".But where did that sense of responsibility come from?According to her, the catalyst was a devastating situation with her best friend at high school.Ms Harris, who was raised in Berkeley in California, moved to Montreal in Canada for high school with her mother Shyamala Gopalan and sister Maya after Ms Gopalan, a breast cancer scientist, got a research job there.Trump v Harris: How body language spoke as loudly as the wordsWhere did Donald Trump's pet-eating claims come from?Aggression, disrespect and insult - a confrontation that Trump has rarely facedIt was at West Mount High School where she met fellow student Wanda Kagan, who was also new.The pair quickly became best friends. But as they grew closer, Ms Harris could sense something was off.She first spoke about the incident in a video uploaded to her social media in 2020, with permission from Ms Kagan.""I suspected something, because she would come to school and just be sad,"" Ms Harris said in a video.""And there were times when she just didn't seem to want to go home.""And I remember asking her: 'Is everything ok?' I just sensed it.""Her best friend then told her she was being sexually and physically abused by her stepfather.""And so I said to her as soon as she told me: 'Well, you have to come stay with us,'"" Ms Harris said.""And a big part of the reason I wanted to be a prosecutor was to protect people like her.""Ms Gopalan took the teenager in and helped her navigate the system to get the support she needed, Ms Kagan told Sky News in 2020.Expanding on her experiences last month, Ms Kagan told MSNBC Ms Harris ""rescued"" her and that she, along with her family, gave her ""stability and structured me into believing I could continue my education"".Ms Kagan, who still lives in Montreal and went on to have a career in healthcare, said it's been an ""emotional ride"" to watch Ms Harris go on to ""fight for the American people just like she fought for me over 40 years ago"".""I want them [voters] to see that she's exactly the kind of person that she's always been from over 40 years ago in high school when she rescued me and it wasn't just 'say something' - it was 'do something'.""She was going to make sure that something was done and to advocate for me even after I went to live with her and her mum and Maya.""She has those protective instincts.

""I know she's always had an impact on my life and where I am today.""How Harris got hereAfter finishing high school, she went on to graduate from Howard University and then the University of California Hastings College of Law, which she graduated from in 1989.The following year she became deputy prosecutor in Alameda County in California, specialising in prosecuting child sexual assault cases, but also working on homicide and robbery cases.She worked there until 1998 when she was made managing attorney of a criminal unit at the San Francisco District Attorney's Office before becoming head of the San Francisco City Attorney's Division on Families and Children.She became the first female district attorney for San Francisco in 2004. During her first three years in the position, the conviction rate in the city jumped from 52% to 67%.She served for six years before being elected as attorney general of California in 2010, where she oversaw the largest state justice department in the country.In 2016, she won the US Senate race in California, beating fellow Democrat Loretta Sanchez who had 20 years' experience in Congress.Here, she built a reputation around her work as a prosecutor and gained national attention during her forensic questioning of Trump administration officials including Jeff Sessions, and then Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.She had become a prominent politician by the time she launched a campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in January 2019, going with the slogan ""Kamala Harris for the People"".Democrats saw her as a promising candidate to overthrow Donald Trump's presidency in the 2020 election, but Ms Harris ultimately dropped out of the race in December 2019, blaming a lack of finances.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeJoe Biden selected her as his running mate in August 2021, describing her as a ""fearless fighter for the little guy"".It made her the first black female running mate for the two major parties, and only the third female running mate for the two major parties in American history.Fast-forward around three years and President Joe Biden, who was struggling in the aftermath of a disastrous debate against Mr Trump, opted to bow out of the 2024 election and endorse his vice president for his position.

three times the speed of sound).The missiles connect to satellites after being launched so they can hit targets at a speed of Mach 4 (3,069mph).It is believed the Iranians are using the Russian's GLONASS satellite navigation system, which provides an alternative to GPS.British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the supply of ballistic missiles from Iran to Russia was ""definitely a significant escalation"" and said the UK was ""coordinating"".However, when asked if he would approve Ukraine's use of the Storm Shadow long-range missiles to strike targets inside Russia, Mr Lammy said he would not comment on ""operational issues"".The US will be announcing further sanctions on Iran later on Tuesday, Mr Blinken said, including further measures against Iran Air.He said other countries were also expected to announce fresh sanctions.Security and Defence EditorIran's decision to send ballistic missiles to Russia as its two-year invasion of Ukraine rages on has been branded as a ""significant escalation"" by UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy.It is a serious step-up in what is already a significant level of military assistance given by Iran to its ally, which until now had comprised attack drones, ammunition and artillery shells -

10-09-2024,SkyNews,US,Tim Walz: The arrest that changed his life - and how it shaped his political career,"""You have responsibilities to others. You can't afford to make foolish decisions.""Those are the words Tim Walz's wife Gwen said to him after he was arrested for drink-driving at the age of 31.Now Kamala Harris's vice president nominee, Mr Walz looks back on this as a defining incident in his life, describing it as a ""life-changing"" moment.Mr Walz, now 60 and running to be the Democratic vice president, offered to resign from his teaching job and permanently swapped alcohol for Diet Mountain Dew, he told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis while running for governor of Minnesota in 2018.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player23 September 1995Tim Walz was working as a geography teacher and football coach at a high school in Nebraska when he was stopped by police on 23 September 1995.He had not long got his teaching degree and met his wife of a year Gwen, who was also a teacher from Minnesota.He had been watching college football with some friends when he was pulled over going 96mph in a 55mph zone.According to court documents, the state police officer smelled alcohol on his breath and Mr Walz failed initial breath tests.He was taken to a nearby hospital for a blood test and booked into Dawes County Jail.Court documents show he had 0.128% alcohol in his blood, which was over the legal limit of 0.1%.His lawyer claimed Mr Walz initially thought the police car was chasing him because it came up so quickly behind him and didn't turn its lights on.Ultimately Mr Walz took a plea deal and the charge was reduced to reckless driving. He lost his licence and was fined $200 (£152).'Real disappointed in himself'When the case came to court in March 1996, Mr Walz's defence lawyer said that as a high school teacher and role model to his students, he felt ""terrible"" and was ""real disappointed, I guess, in himself"".The arrest saw him give up his coaching position - and even offer his resignation to his principal because he ""felt so bad"".His boss convinced him to stay, however, so instead Mr Walz used the experience to warn his pupils of the dangers of drink-driving.He told the courtroom: ""It's just a dangerous situation. Not just to myself, but to others who aren't even involved with it.""Tim Walz's drink-driving arrest re-emerged in the media soon after Kamala Harris announced he was going to be her running mate this year.But there was some confusion over false claims he wasn't over the limit.When he was running for Congress in 2006, his campaign spokesperson told a local news outlet in Minnesota he was not drunk that night in 1995.She said of the decision to reduce the charge to reckless driving: ""The DUI charge was dropped for a reason: It wasn't true.""She claimed that hearing loss he suffered while with his National Guard artillery unit may have been the reason he failed sobriety tests.There were also false reports given by his team that he had been allowed to drive himself to the police station – where he was later allowed to leave of his own accord.Court documents have since shown no mention of any hearing issues – and that he was driven to Dawes County Jail by officers.Speaking to his local newspaper in the run-up to his 2018 election as governor, Mr Walz reflected on how his run-in with the law changed his perspective.His father, a school administrator, died when he was 19.In an interview, he said it left him feeling as though his life had been ""ripped up"" and, throwing caution to the wind, saw him take unnecessary risks.He had joined the National Guard two years before, but instead of pursuing a military career, he went to China. It was only the second time ever he had got on a plane. He spent a year teaching there, which coincided with the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.On his return to the US he moved from state to state - Nebraska to Texas to Arkansas - where he ended up working in a factory that made beds for tanning salons.Bridging dividesHe returned to Nebraska, took up his first US teaching post and a full-time job with the National Guard, with football coaching on the side.Before long he started dating his wife, whom he married in 1994. They have two children - daughter Hope who was born in 2001 and son Gus born in 2006.After the couple moved back to Minnesota, Mr Walz swapped the National Guard, where he had progressed to command sergeant major by the time he left in 2005, with politics.That year he ran for Congress in the Republican-leaning 1st district of Minnesota.Read moreWho is Tim Walz?Walz accused of lying about fertility treatmentAnalysis: Why Harris picked WalzDuring the campaign, he established himself as someone who could build bridges - in a traditionally Democrat state surrounded by the Republican rural heartlands of Wisconsin and Michigan.He gave an example of when he was still a teacher in 1999 - and one of his pupils wanted to start a gay-straight alliance - just three years after President Bill Clinton had signed the Defence of Marriage Act, effectively banning same-sex marriage.In his National Guard days, he had seen LGBT people threatened with discharge, and at school, pupils bullied by their peers for their sexuality.Seeing the potential to cut through to its critics, Mr Walz became the group's faculty adviser.He told a newspaper interview: ""It really needed to be the football coach, who was the soldier and was straight and was married.""After beating the Republican incumbent to take his House seat in 2007, he stayed there for 12 years, before successfully running for governor in 2018.When Kamala Harris announced him as her VP pick this year, she said: ""As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he's delivered for working families like his.""",https://news.sky.com/story/tim-walz-the-arrest-that-changed-his-life-and-how-it-shaped-his-political-career-13208883
10-09-2024,SkyNews,US,JD Vance: How vice-presidential candidate used his 'hillbilly' background to catapult himself to the top of US politics,"When JD Vance says he came from nothing, he really means it.There are plenty of clichés that seemingly encapsulate how a child born in poverty can go on to become a vice presidential candidate by the age of 39; it's almost the perfect example of the ""American Dream"".But Donald Trump's running mate isn't in this position in spite of his challenging upbringing - in many ways, he's there because of it.This is how JD Vance took his experiences as a self-proclaimed hillbilly and used them to write a bestselling book and propel himself to the top of politics.Hillbilly ElegyIn his 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy, Mr Vance, born into an impoverished household in southern Ohio, shares stories about his chaotic family life and about communities that had declined and seemed to lose hope.He details his own journey and how he navigated his dysfunctional family.Trump v Harris: How body language spoke as loudly as the wordsWhere did Donald Trump's pet-eating claims come from?Aggression, disrespect and insult - a confrontation that Trump has rarely facedThere's his grandmother, who he refers to as Mamaw, who helped raise him on ""tough love"" - and once doused his Papaw with gasoline and dropped a lit match to punish him for being unfaithful. He escaped with minor burns.Then there is his mother, who struggled to care for him as she battled a drug addiction and at one point forced him to provide a urine sample for her drug test.He analyses his experiences growing up in Ohio to reflect on why the working-class American region of Appalachia, which consists of 13 states from southern New York to northern Mississippi, changed from reliably Democratic to reliably Republican.He does this not just by looking at his family, but also at the troubled community around him. He highlights the impact the steel industry's struggles in the 1970s had on his city, along with the opioid crisis which plagued the country.""It is in Greater Appalachia where the fortunes of working-class whites seem dimmest. From low social mobility to poverty to divorce and drug addiction, my home is a hub of misery,"" he writes in the introduction.He goes on to say he identifies with the ""millions of working-class Americans who have no college degree"".""To these folks, poverty is the family tradition - their ancestors were day labourers in the southern slave economy, share-croppers after that, and machinists and millworkers during more recent times.""Americans call them hillbillies, rednecks or white trash. I call them neighbours, friends and family.""The book was written by Mr Vance in his late 20s/early 30s. By that point, he had gone on to serve in the Marine Corps, graduate from Yale Law School where he met his wife Usha, and become a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley.Critical acclaim - and some critiquesTo many liberal Americans struggling to understand why a wealthy New York businessman like Donald Trump was appealing to so many struggling working-class voters in the 2016 US election, the book was something of a revelation.And conservatives were also widely keen on the book, which criticised the welfare system and what Vance saw as ""too many young men immune to hard work"".Read more:Your ultimate guide to the US electionHow Vance defends his 'childless cat ladies' remarksVladimir Putin reveals who he wants to win US electionIt was called ""one of the six best books to help understand Trump's win"", by The New York Times and given rave reviews by the likes of The Wall Street Journal and The Economist.But it also garnered plenty of criticism, with some - particularly across Appalachia - faulting it as a stereotypical and misleading portrait of the region and of poverty in the US, while ignoring the role of racism in politics.National talk shows and columnists - whether praising the book or finding fault with it - were giving it plenty of publicity.Memoir sells millionsThe book quickly hit best-seller lists and sold more than three million copies before Mr Trump chose him for the Republican ticket, according to its publishers HarperCollins.The memoir's sales were boosted in 2020 after it was made into a Netflix film directed by Ron Howard and starring Amy Adams as Mr Vance's mum Bev and Glenn Close as his grandmother.Mr Vance himself was played by Gabriel Basso, while Owen Asztalos played a younger version of him in flashbacks.And as Mr Vance moved away from capital ventures and into politics, his stock continued to rise.He became a popular political commentator on TV and announced he was running to become the state of Ohio's senator in 2022. He was subsequently elected and sworn into office in January 2023.Once a 'never Trumper'It's clear to see Mr Vance always understood the former president's appeal for voters.""He communicates in a way that is very relatable to a lot of people; it's one of the things that both parties frankly have been increasingly bad at, which is connecting to voters in an emotional and kind of visceral way, and I think Trump does that,"" he said in August 2016 - months before Mr Trump was elected.""And he is tapping into a substantive concern that people have... the sense America's best days are behind it and the future doesn't hold a whole lot of promise.""While he may have understood him, Mr Vance was actually highly critical of Mr Trump in 2016.He once described himself as a ""never Trumper"" and - after his election win - labelled the then-president an ""idiot"" and said he could be ""America's Hitler"".""I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole like Nixon who wouldn't be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he's America's Hitler,"" Mr Vance wrote privately to an associate on Facebook in 2016.When his Hitler comment was first reported, in 2022, a spokesperson did not dispute it, but said it no longer represented Vance's views.Vance's Trump U-turnMr Vance of course changed his mind.The book itself may have even played a big role in that process, as he is said to have grown close with Donald Trump Jr because he was a big fan of the memoir.The two became friends and by the time Mr Vance met Mr Trump in 2021, he had reversed his opinion, citing his accomplishments as president.By the time Mr Vance ran for the Senate in 2022 his demonstrations of loyalty - which included downplaying the January 6 Capitol riots - were sufficient to score Mr Trump's coveted endorsement.Mr Trump's support helped put him over the top in a competitive primary.In interviews Mr Vance has said there was no 'eureka' moment that changed his mind on Mr Trump.

a lightweight semi-automatic rifle often associated with school shootings.On Friday a judge ruled that the teenager would not face the death penalty because, as a juvenile, the maximum sentence he can receive is life without parole.Suspect's mother 'called the school 30 minutes before attack'Gray's aunt has claimed his mother called one of the high school's counsellors warning of an ""extreme emergency"" 30 minutes before he allegedly opened fire there.Annie Brown, the teenager's aunt, told the Washington Post the boy's mother also said they needed to find Gray ""immediately"".Phone records shared with the newspaper, and later confirmed by the Associated Press, show a 10-minute call was made from the family's shared phone plan to the school at that time.Gray had been investigated beforeGray was investigated by police over threats to carry out a similar attack last year, the FBI said in a statement on Wednesday.They said they received several anonymous tips about Gray telling people on the gaming platform Discord that he might carry out a shooting.The FBI interviewed Gray, then 13, who denied making the threats, and his father, who stated he had hunting guns locked in a safe in the family home but that his son did not have unsupervised access to them.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerHe said the teenager had struggled with his parents' separation and often got picked on at school.""He knows the seriousness of weapons and what they can do, and how to use them and not use them,"" the boy's father said, according to a transcript of the interview.He also mentioned his son becoming ""flustered under pressure"" and ""not really thinking straight"".""I don't want him to fight anybody, but they just keep like pinching him and touching him,"" he told investigators in May 2023.Ultimately the case was closed after neither Colt nor Colin Gray were successfully linked to the Discord account the threats were made from.There were no grounds to confiscate the family's guns either, according to police reports released by the sheriff's office.Authorities are now re-investigating the incident and any possible connection it may have to the most recent shooting.After speaking about the FBI statement, Mr Hosey said: ""We are also aware of some previous contacts that the Department of Family and Children Services had had with the suspect and his family, and we are pursuing that avenue as well.""Law enforcement sources have told NBC News Colin Gray bought his son an AR-style rifle as a gift after the pair were questioned.What we know about the victimsThe four victims who died have been named as students Mason Schermerhorn and Christian Angulo, both 14, and teachers Richard Aspenwall, 39, and Christina Irimie, 53.Christian was described as ""a very good kid and very sweet and so caring"" by his older sister, Lisette Angulo.""He was so loved by many. His loss was so sudden and unexpected. We are truly heartbroken. He really didn't deserve this,"" she added.Mr Aspenwall and Ms Irimie both taught maths, according to the school's website, with the former also listed as a defensive coordinator for the football team.Read more:Boy, 8, fatally shoots himself with mother's gunFour people shot dead 'execution-style' on trainNine other people, eight students and one teacher, were injured in the attack.

""I don't want to meet the Lord that way.""Student Jacob King said he had dozed off in his world history class after morning football practice when he heard around 10 gunshots.He said he did not believe the shooting was real until he heard an officer yelling at someone to put down their gun. He said that when his class was led out, he saw officers shielding what appeared to be an injured student.Ashley Enoh said she was at home on Wednesday morning when she got a text from her brother, who is a senior at the school.The message said: ""Just so you know, I love you.""When she asked in the family group chat what was going on, he said there was a gunman at the school.Shirley Power spoke to Sky News' US partner NBC News about learning of the shooting at her grandchild's school from her daughter.""My daughter called me at work screaming that there was a shooter at Apalachee and begged me to get there as quick as possible,"" Ms Powers said.She said the principal instructed her grandson to run to the band room.""Start praying, for all the kids, not just my grandson,"" she added.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerAuthorities were alerted to the attack due to a new alarm system that had only been implemented a week earlier.Sheriff Jud Smith said: ""All of our teachers are armed with a form of ID, this alarms us and alerts law enforcement officers after buttons are pressed on the ID.""It alerts us there is an active situation at the school.

09-09-2024,SkyNews,US,"Three key challenges for Kamala Harris: Biden's shadow, Trump's 'comrade' attacks and her interview problem ","Donald Trump and Kamala Harris face intense scrutiny in the remaining two months of the US election campaign.Ever since Ms Harris became the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee with Joe Biden's historic announcement he would not seek re-election, she has enjoyed a rapid ascent in polling.But momentum can swing quickly in an election campaign, and issues persist for both candidates - which could be crucial at their first debate on Tuesday.Read more:Your ultimate guide to the US electionThe challenges facing TrumpA recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College puts the former president one point ahead of the vice president, at 48% to 47% respectively.With only weeks to go until America goes to the polls, here's a look at three key challenges for the Democratic nominee...Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeRepublicans portray Kamala Harris as a California liberal of the hard left, a ""radical left lunatic"" as Donald Trump would have it.They point to her 'flip-flopping' on key policy areas and insist it exposes an extreme left agenda, while raising questions of authenticity and trust.In her effort to win the Democratic nomination in 2020, Harris took a left-leaning stance on several issues as she paid heed to her party's progressive wing. That has changed with her political elevation.As vice president, she duly aligned herself more centrally with the administration of the day and so modified her position on issues.On fracking - she favoured a ban, now doesn't; for healthcare, she backed a scheme to eliminate private insurance, now doesn't; on illegal border crossings, she supported decriminalisation, and now doesn't.In a recent interview, Harris addressed her shift by saying her values hadn't changed and her time as VP had given her a fresh perspective.Her opponents will insist she has chosen convenience over conviction in a cynical bid to hoodwink independent, moderate voters.There's a reason Joe Biden was struggling in the polls - his age didn't help, of course, but neither did his record.On a matter most important - the economy - he can cite improvement, having delivered on GDP, unemployment and inflation.His difficulty is in the economic indicators more measurable and meaningful to the public - prices at the petrol pumps and in the shops - that have left Americans feeling the pinch and feeling less well off than they were four years ago.Inflation may be falling, but prices are roughly 20% higher than they were during the COVID pandemic. As hard as the president has tried to sell ""Bidenomics,"" the voters aren't buying.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerIn her effort to escape the shadow of economic angst, Harris has unveiled proposals she says will cut costs and is punting a populist line that casts big business and greedy landlords as the villains making life difficult.Departing from Biden's big picture boasting about economic wins and legislative victories, she aims to talk money in terms the voter understands and to empathise with their concerns.The strategy needs to work for her. A CNBC survey in August found 40% of voters said they'd be better off financially under a Trump presidency compared to 21% if Harris won.Harris's opponents say that, as a core member of the existing government, she bears responsibility for the public's financial woes.They insist she will also have to answer for the record of the Biden administration as a whole - expect her to face awkward questions, too, on subjects like Afghanistan and the Israel/Hamas conflict.Read more:Will Starmer meet with Harris and Trump?Five things we learnt in Harris's DNC speechKeep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsKamala Harris can work a crowd.At the Democratic National Convention and at rallies across the country, she has demonstrated a stage presence and sure-footedness that energises the faithful.

Even then, it was with running mate Tim Walz by her side.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerThat's one set-piece - or joint - interview in six weeks.It would be an astonishing lack of independent scrutiny for someone bidding to be a local parish councillor, let alone president of the United States.There remain questions unasked of Kamala Harris and the apparent reluctance to address them creates a sense of vulnerability.The enthusiasm for a change in the ticket has shored up the Democratic vote, no doubt, but Harris needs to extend her reach to the undecideds, independents and Republicans feeling reluctant about Trump.They need to know who she is and what she stands for. Harris has come a distance in the polls but they are starting to look sticky.She needs the extra votes. If the TV interview is a risk, it's one she might have to take - more than once every six weeks.It's one thing rolling out the teleprompted hits to the adoring masses, it's quite another sitting down for independent interrogation.That, perhaps more than elsewhere, is where judgement lies.",https://news.sky.com/story/three-key-challenges-for-kamala-harris-bidens-shadow-trumps-comrade-attacks-and-her-interview-problem-13211760

Such is the draw of Donald Trump in places like this.I'm back in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, a town I've been to a few times over the past eight years.I was first here in 2016, on the night when Donald Trump dramatically defeated Hillary Clinton - the election which propelled him to the White House. I returned four years later when Trump lost to Joe Biden.This is a rust belt town which feels now to be rusting away.It's one of those neglected places in America, a town bypassed by highways and forgotten by people who live a better life somewhere else.The thriving steel industry on which Johnstown was built is long gone. The vast metal plant which once dominated the town centre now employs just a fraction of the workers. Young people who see opportunity elsewhere leave as soon as they can.Main Street is now a collection of vape stores, fast food franchises, the odd shop and boarded up businesses.

And today, there is a buzz in the air because their man is passing through.With 10 weeks to go until the most pivotal of elections, Donald Trump and his opponent, Kamala Harris, are criss-crossing the country, shuttling between the few swing states where the future of this country will be decided.In Pennsylvania and just a few other states, the margins are so tight, it could swing either way.And so, just as he did in 2016 and 2020, Donald Trump came to Johnstown to tell the people here, again, that he will make their lives better.""We're going to win back the White House."" he told the cheering crowd in a packed arena.""We're going to make this country greater than it's ever been... We're going to bring in tremendous numbers of factories.""Together, we will deliver low taxes, low regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates, low inflation, so that everyone can afford groceries, a car and a home.""He hit every button and here, among the faithful who attend these rallies, they believe his pledges.But here's the thing. Despite his promises, he never got the factories outside this arena re-opened when he was last president.A combination of factors is fuelling Trump's enduring appeal.Part of it is explained by deep-set conservative Christian values which Trumpian Republicanism has latched on to so well - the yearning for 'the good old days'.Part of it is the soaring inflation over the past few years - the sharp post-pandemic increase in global commodity prices, compounded by Ukraine war-related supply chain and energy delivery disruption. Here, in this rally, among Mr Trump's supporters, Joe Biden foots the blame for all that. He's been the president. No debate.But it's also viscerally clear that part of America feels marginalised and ignored as 'progressive' liberals progress with policies and lifestyles that people in places like Johnstown feel are not aligned with them or helping them.Put simply, the lives of the people in this arena felt better back under the first Trump term, despite the unfulfilled promises, because they have felt even worse through the past four years under Joe Biden.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerDonald Trump, the salesman, has harnessed this anger with pitch-perfect rhetoric.

10-09-2024,SkyNews,US,Donald Trump: How reality TV and prime-time cameos helped get him to the White House - could it happen again?,"""My name is Donald Trump and I'm the largest real estate developer in New York. I own buildings all over the place. I've mastered the art of the deal and turned the name Trump into the highest-quality brand.""This is how Donald Trump introduced himself in the opening credits of The Apprentice when it first aired on 8 January 2004.He was already a well-known businessman, having turned his father Fred's rental company into a billion-dollar real estate empire. His turbulent finances - and love life - had also gained him notoriety in the tabloid press.But it was his 11 years on The Apprentice that many say solidified his reputation - and paved the way to his shock White House win of 2016 - and second attempt at the presidency this year.'My jet's going to be in every episode'When NBC first had the idea for The Apprentice, Donald Trump was one of many moguls who would sit at the boardroom table - with others proposed to front future series.But having negotiated a 50% stake in the show and the episodes being filmed in Trump Tower, potential successors were soon shelved - and Trump stayed at the helm for 14 seasons.According to reports, filming for the first episode, ""Meet The Billionaire"", overran by hours, and Trump would call the channel at 6am the day after each one aired to get the earliest viewing figures.Seemingly laser-focused on how the show could promote his businesses, he reportedly told TV bosses at the time: ""My jet's going to be in every episode. Even if it doesn't get the ratings, it's still going to be great for my brand.""Read moreTrump's criminal casesFive things to watch at Harris-Trump debateWho's on track to win the US election?Further episodes were entitled ""Sex, Lies and Altitude"" and ""Ethics Schmethics"".Meanwhile, his opening voiceover acknowledged his previous financial difficulties, claiming, ""It wasn't always easy,"" and that ""15 years ago I was seriously in trouble… billions of dollars in debt"".But he then exclaimed: ""I fought back and I won… bigly.""I used my brain and my negotiating skills and I worked it all out. Now my company is the biggest and strongest it ever was. And I'm having more fun than I ever have.""During his time on the show, he battled bankruptcies, court cases, and personal scandal.But with 20 million viewers in the first year alone, his 'The Donald' persona and 'You're fired' catchphrase is what many Americans knew and remembered him for.Fresh Prince and Sex And The CityAfter rebranding his father's business empire the Trump Organization in 1971, he was often pictured with celebrities at parties and married Czech model and athlete Ivana Zelnickova in 1977.His longstanding feud with then New York mayor Ed Koch often played out in newspaper and magazine interviews - also helping ensure he stayed in the public eye.Meanwhile, throughout the 1980s and 1990s he bought casinos, hotels, and golf courses - as well as an American football team, 282ft yacht, and the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants.During the 1990s, he also started making cameos on TV.When the Home Alone sequel Lost In New York was released in 1992, both Trump and one of his biggest assets - Manhattan's Plaza Hotel - were featured.In 1994 he and his second wife, actress and TV presenter Marla Marples, played themselves in an episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.As prospective buyers of the family home, Will Smith's on-screen cousin Carlton screams: ""It's The Donald, oh my god!"" before fainting, before his sister Hilary says: ""You look much richer in person.""When he appeared in the sitcom The Nanny in 1996, his team is reported to have asked scriptwriters to change the reference to him from a millionaire to a billionaire.He also made appearances in the film The Little Rascals and as a business contact of a rich older man trying to seduce Kim Cattrall's character Samantha in Sex And The City.Meanwhile, the Trump empire was suffering major financial difficulty.The US recession of the early 1990s hit Trump's businesses and he eventually accumulated $5bn (£3.8bn) in debt.He was forced to sell his airline, yacht, and take out third mortgages on most of his properties, with many banks refusing to do business with him as a result.In the 1990s and 2000s, Trump filed for bankruptcy six times.Deutsche Bank came to his rescue, however, when they entered the US market in the early 2000s offering him millions in credit to fund Trump Tower among other projects.Away from business, in 2005, Trump married his third wife, Melania.Dropped by Apprentice over Mexico claimsTrump had flirted with politics from 2000, running as a candidate for the fringe Reform Party in the California and Michigan primaries.That year, he also published a book called The America We Deserve, in which he expressed a series of conservative political views.Over the next decade, he registered as both a Republican and a Democrat.He made moves towards another presidential bid, this time as a Republican, in 2011, but ultimately declared he wouldn't run.Despite his failure to progress, he received widespread attention for promoting 'birtherism' - a conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the US.The start of Trump's political career marked the end of his time on The Apprentice.In June 2015, NBC dropped him from the show over comments during his campaign launch speech about US Mexican immigrants being ""rapists"" and ""bringing drugs"".It was during this speech that he first vowed to ""Make America Great Again"", having declared the American Dream ""dead"".His campaign was overseen by the right-wing media figure Steve Bannon, who he appointed chief executive in mid-2016. In rally speeches, he made promises to ""build a wall"" along the US-Mexico border and throw his Democrat opponent Hillary Clinton in prison over claims she was ""crooked"".He trailed in the opinion polls and an audio clip from 2005 appeared to reveal him bragging about sexually assaulting women.But despite many failing to take him seriously, the race narrowed and Clinton suffered a shock defeat, paving the way for a Trump White House in January 2017.Twitter presidentTrump continued causing controversy when he entered the Oval Office.He often bypassed official communication channels, preferring to make formal policy announcements on Twitter instead.Domestically, he made moves to dismantle Obamacare, and shifted the political makeup of the Supreme Court by nominating three conservative justices, which has since led to the overturning of constitutional abortion rights through Roe v Wade.He quickly imposed what was dubbed a 'Muslim ban', temporarily stopping immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries.Abroad, he withdrew the US from the Paris Climate Agreement and fundamentally changed trade relations with China and other key states.He was praised for spearheading the Abraham Accords, which normalised relations between Israel, the UAE, and Bahrain, and many hoped would help move closer to peace for Israel-Palestine.Despite declaring he had ""made peace in the Middle East"", however, he also withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal.Meanwhile, his 2016 election campaign was investigated for alleged Russian interference. More than 30 people were charged, with his former attorney Michael Cohen among those sent to prison. Trump himself was never indicted and the special counsel probe failed to show any criminal collusion.He was impeached twice - the first time in 2019 after an inquiry found he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to dig up dirt on his 2020 election rival Joe Biden - and the second time over the 6 January insurrection.His handling of the coronavirus pandemic was widely criticised - but supported by libertarians, mask and vaccine sceptics.Despite contracting the virus in October 2020, he repeatedly referred to it as the ""China virus"" and made false claims that bleach could cure it.At the November election, Trump got 74 million votes - more than any other sitting president in history - but lost by seven million overall.Insurrection, impeachments and indictmentsTrump immediately disputed the 2020 election result, claiming widespread electoral fraud in multiple states.His ""stop the steal"" campaign culminated in a ""Save America"" rally at Washington DC's National Mall on 6 January 2021.Ahead of the formal verification of votes by the Electoral College, Trump urged supporters to ""fight like hell"", vowing ""we will never concede"" and ""we are going to the Capitol"".When the rally ended, a mob descended on the Capitol, breaking into buildings, making death threats, and causing damage.Six people died as a result, Trump was impeached for a second time, and he faced both criminal and civil lawsuits.The aftermath saw Trump largely abandoned by the Republican Party.He refused to attend his successor's inauguration and was banned by nearly all mainstream social media platforms, leading him to set up his own - Truth Social - in 2022.Momentum began to build against him legally - and he faced criminal cases for alleged electoral fraud in Georgia, the removal of classified documents in Florida, and 'hush money' over an affair with former adult film star Stormy Daniels in New York.The Florida case was thrown out but he became the first US president in history to be convicted when he was found guilty in the hush money case. He is yet to be sentenced.Separately, he lost two civil lawsuits in New York - one for sexually assaulting and defaming the writer E Jean Caroll and a second for overvaluing his business assets to secure bank loans. The fines for both totalled almost £350m.ComebackAfter the insurrection, Republican donors, congressmen and women effectively disowned Trump and he was blamed for the party's results in the 2022 midterm elections.But he remained popular with the grassroots, and had a more direct line to them when Elon Musk took over Twitter, reinstating Trump's account.Trump used the criminal cases against him to fuel his anti-establishment image and amid poor approval ratings for Joe Biden and a lack of another clear candidate, he re-emerged as a serious contender for the Republican nomination.At the same time, Mr Biden's age and mental capacity came increasingly into question.And after confusing Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy with Russia's Vladimir Putin - and a disastrous TV debate, during which Trump said ""I don't think he knows what he said"", he was forced to pull out of the 2024 race.Trump's narrow escape from an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally emboldened him and his supporters further.His defiant raised fist and ear injury became symbols of the subsequent Republican Convention, where he formally accepted the party's nomination and his most loyal followers sported solidarity ear bandages.He now faces Kamala Harris for the presidency and a second shot at the White House on 5 November.",https://news.sky.com/story/donald-trump-how-reality-tv-and-prime-time-cameos-helped-get-him-to-the-white-house-could-it-happen-again-13210496
11-09-2024,SkyNews,US,Who is favourite to win the US election? Follow the latest polls and play our game to predict who you think will win,"The presidential election on 5 November is set to be the tightest race since at least 2000.Kamala Harris currently holds a slender lead over Donald Trump, according to the latest polls.But the US election is not all about who wins the most votes overall, it's about who wins in the right states.How does the US election work?iIf we add up the votes in ""safe"" states that the candidates probably don't need to worry about so much, Harris is on 225 electoral college votes and Trump on 219, in their race to 270.Of the 94 votes left in the eight crucial swing states where the races are tight, Harris needs 45 to win the presidency and Trump needs 51.Harris is currently leading in a majority of those.Read analysis and follow reaction of the debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump our live blogBut the leads are narrow. All it takes is for Trump to turn fortunes around in any two of the larger states and he will reach the 51 he needs to win.After the debate on 10 September, Kamala Harris also retook the lead in the betting markets, but only by the narrowest of margins, reflecting a belief among punters that the race is very far from over.Predict who you think will win in each swing state and we'll tell you who the president will be if you're right.Swing statesWe can already be fairly confident of the result in lots of states. California and New York for example have voted Democrat at every election for the past 30 years.Texas is the same the other way around - they haven't voted for a Democrat since Jimmy Carter in 1976, almost 50 years ago. Only five states changed hands in 2020.That's why those eight states that could go either way are so very important.If Trump doesn't win in Pennsylvania, his route to victory becomes increasingly narrow - he would need to win at least four of the six biggest remaining states.If he does win there, however, he can become president with just two others.There is no recent polling in Nebraska’s second district by pollsters recognised by our US partners NBC News, but that single electoral vote could make all the difference if other states go a certain way.If Trump wins Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan and loses North Carolina, Arizona, Wisconsin and Nevada, he would be stuck on 269 - Nebraska 2nd would take him over the line.What happens if it's a tie in the electoral college?iEach of the fifty states, plus Washington DC, holds their own vote for president which is independent from the others.Each state is worth an amount of ""electoral college votes"" - effectively points - related to the population of the state.California, the most populous US state, has 54 electoral college votes representing their 39 million population.Wyoming, the smallest US state, has three electoral college votes representing their 600,000 population.There are 538 ""points"" in total. To become president, a candidate must get to 270 (more than half). It doesn't matter what combination of states gets them there, but some routes are easier than others.In most states - all except Nebraska and Maine - the winning candidate in a state gets all of the electoral votes available.So if Donald Trump was to win Florida by a single vote, he would get all 30 of their electoral college votes, the same as if he got 100% of the popular vote there.In Nebraska, two votes are allocated to who wins the state overall, and one each to the candidate who wins in three districts of Nebraska - making five overall. It's the same in Maine but there are only four electoral college votes up for grabs there, so its other votes are split across two districts rather than three.Who is the bookies' favourite?We’ve mostly spoken about the polls so far, but there’s another often overlooked way to gauge the potential outcome of the election - by looking at where people are putting their money.Betting markets, unlike polls, are driven by people willing to back their predictions with real money. This means they reflect not just today’s opinions but also the collective wisdom of people who are invested in the outcome about how things might change going forward.Sky News is tracking the odds of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump winning the 2024 election. We've translated the odds into percentages to reflect the implied probability of each candidate's victory.The percentage refers to the candidates' overall chance of winning, by whatever margin, not an implied vote share or electoral college split.Who is the people's favourite?Sometimes it's not about policy but just about whether you like one candidate more than another.Americans are more likely to find Donald Trump unfavourable than favourable, but he has had a recent (relative) jump in popularity.It's the reverse for Harris at the moment - she had a brief bounce after becoming the official candidate, but has since dropped to a level close to Trump's new high.As the election approaches, keep an eye on all these trackers to see the polls and betting markets' predictions evolve, and what they reveal about where the race to become president is going.The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

Many have endured months, even years, on the road.All the latest US election updatesSometimes travelling thousands of miles through hostile countries, outwitting cartel gangs, and managing dizzyingly contradictory bureaucracy, all to get to this point: an asylum interview with United States border officials, and almost certain entry.On the migrant 'Train of Death': Electric shocks, beatings and brandingsOn its face, this all sounds like a system working in perfect harmony with the needy being helped by a welcoming country.But in reality, migration is a hotly disputed issue that is likely to dominate the Trump-Harris debate, and the run-up to the presidential election itself.You can watch live coverage of the debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump from midnight tonight on Sky News, on web and on mobileWho is ahead in the US election polls?Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsThe group I am with on the bridge is mostly from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Venezuela.They're claiming asylum, and with their paperwork and appointment email in hand, they approach the border with some trepidation but mostly with excitement and joy.Many have waited months for their appointment to come through after applying for asylum on the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) app.This group of a few hundred people on the bridge are now just a few steps from America.As they shuffle forward, CBP guards check their papers, make sure there are no errors, and wave them through to the other side for their case interviews.These families, these children, are about to start a new life.Along the border here in Matamoros, there's little sign of Donald Trump's border wall, but he'd doubtless approve of the razor wire fortifications on the American side of the Rio Grande.Experts here say there's no doubt who those seeking asylum are backing in this election and this debate - and that's Kamala Harris, who is seen to have a far less hostile approach to immigration.""I think the best would be a flexible US immigration policy again, like President Biden's when he began his administration,"" Oscar Misael Hernandez-Hernandez said as we chatted alongside the dozens of cars and trucks crossing the border.A professor of social anthropology at the El Colegio de la Frontera Norte research centre and an expert on Mexico-US border issues, he added: ""Biden broke with ultra-conservative vision and immigration policy.""So, I think if Harris implements a migration policy like this if she wins the presidency of the United States, it would be not only quite good for migrants in terms of human rights, but also quite good for international diplomacy, because the relations of the United States, at least with President Trump, if he wins, would be quite disastrous as they were in the past.""Read more:When is the US election?Terrifying risks Indians take to reach USIn shelters and hostels across Mexico, many other migrant families simply have to wait for their border appointments.It's like a lottery, and it can take a long time for their number to come up.Few leave the shelter; they would be easy prey for cartel gangs who would kidnap and hold them for ransom.Marlen Cabrera, 39, from Honduras, and her family are waiting it out along with 200 others at the Casa del Migrante San Francisco de Asis shelter.Any tightening of the immigration rules - as threatened by Donald Trump - would be a disaster for her.I asked her what she would do if the laws changed with a Trump victory. She says she doesn't like to think about what-ifs.""I've been here so long, and not being able to get in would be hard because it's the only option I have,"" she said.""I have to get in. It would be really terrible if we couldn't. And I don't just speak for myself, I speak for everyone here.""Jose Valdivia, the Nicaraguan manager of the shelter, is even clearer.""Everybody, since the last election, we all wanted the Democrats to win, right? Because the Democrats look out for the little guy,"" he told me.""That's what everybody here as a migrant wants, we want the Democrats to win. No one wants Trump.""Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeBe the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeDay in, day out, in any weather, the migrants line up for their appointment here at the border in Matamoros.Along the almost 2,000-mile-long border separating Mexico and the United States, thousands of applicants are screened every day and allowed to enter America legally to start new lives in their new home country.But these migrants are at the centre of one of the most divisive issues in America right now.Since the summer, border restrictions introduced by the Biden administration, combined with assistance from Mexican authorities who hamper the movement of migrants to the border, has brought about a large reduction in the number of people illegally entering America.Despite this, President Biden is widely considered to have failed on immigration, and while Kamala Harris's team have been working hard to cast her as a sort of new candidate and a breath of fresh air, she is - whether they like it or not - part of this administration and is tainted by its perceived failures.The latest polls suggest Donald Trump scores well on the immigration issue, and his team have been releasing pointed ""attack ads"" on Kamala Harris and her team on this subject. They in turn have released adverts attacking Trump.Read more on Sky News:Three key challenges for Donald TrumpHarvey Weinstein in intensive care at hospitalThree challenges Kamala Harris must overcomeIn the debate itself, Trump is widely expected to try to nail Harris on immigration, and she will have to find a way to counter that.Undoubtedly, she will point out that Trump's supporters kiboshed a cross-party action plan for migration, but she is still tainted for certain.While this will all play out in the political rough and tumble of the electoral process, it is important not to forget that thousands upon thousands of people will be affected by America's future stance on immigration.And for some asylum seekers, it is quite literally a matter of life and death.",https://news.sky.com/story/migrants-waiting-on-the-us-border-are-watching-white-house-race-between-harris-and-trump-closely-13212130

09-09-2024,SkyNews,US,"Three key challenges for Kamala Harris: Biden's shadow, Trump's 'comrade' attacks and her interview problem ","Donald Trump and Kamala Harris face intense scrutiny in the remaining two months of the US election campaign.Ever since Ms Harris became the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee with Joe Biden's historic announcement he would not seek re-election, she has enjoyed a rapid ascent in polling.But momentum can swing quickly in an election campaign, and issues persist for both candidates - which could be crucial at their first debate on Tuesday.Read more:Your ultimate guide to the US electionThe challenges facing TrumpA recent survey from the New York Times and Siena College puts the former president one point ahead of the vice president, at 48% to 47% respectively.With only weeks to go until America goes to the polls, here's a look at three key challenges for the Democratic nominee...Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeRepublicans portray Kamala Harris as a California liberal of the hard left, a ""radical left lunatic"" as Donald Trump would have it.They point to her 'flip-flopping' on key policy areas and insist it exposes an extreme left agenda, while raising questions of authenticity and trust.In her effort to win the Democratic nomination in 2020, Harris took a left-leaning stance on several issues as she paid heed to her party's progressive wing. That has changed with her political elevation.As vice president, she duly aligned herself more centrally with the administration of the day and so modified her position on issues.On fracking - she favoured a ban, now doesn't; for healthcare, she backed a scheme to eliminate private insurance, now doesn't; on illegal border crossings, she supported decriminalisation, and now doesn't.In a recent interview, Harris addressed her shift by saying her values hadn't changed and her time as VP had given her a fresh perspective.Her opponents will insist she has chosen convenience over conviction in a cynical bid to hoodwink independent, moderate voters.There's a reason Joe Biden was struggling in the polls - his age didn't help, of course, but neither did his record.On a matter most important - the economy - he can cite improvement, having delivered on GDP, unemployment and inflation.His difficulty is in the economic indicators more measurable and meaningful to the public - prices at the petrol pumps and in the shops - that have left Americans feeling the pinch and feeling less well off than they were four years ago.Inflation may be falling, but prices are roughly 20% higher than they were during the COVID pandemic. As hard as the president has tried to sell ""Bidenomics,"" the voters aren't buying.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerIn her effort to escape the shadow of economic angst, Harris has unveiled proposals she says will cut costs and is punting a populist line that casts big business and greedy landlords as the villains making life difficult.Departing from Biden's big picture boasting about economic wins and legislative victories, she aims to talk money in terms the voter understands and to empathise with their concerns.The strategy needs to work for her. A CNBC survey in August found 40% of voters said they'd be better off financially under a Trump presidency compared to 21% if Harris won.Harris's opponents say that, as a core member of the existing government, she bears responsibility for the public's financial woes.They insist she will also have to answer for the record of the Biden administration as a whole - expect her to face awkward questions, too, on subjects like Afghanistan and the Israel/Hamas conflict.Read more:Will Starmer meet with Harris and Trump?Five things we learnt in Harris's DNC speechKeep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsKamala Harris can work a crowd.At the Democratic National Convention and at rallies across the country, she has demonstrated a stage presence and sure-footedness that energises the faithful. She's comfortable among friends.There remain questions about her vulnerability in more challenging surroundings and, in a country where politics is heavy on performance, that matters.A 2021 interview that Harris conducted with NBC's Lester Holt is given an occasional dusting off, which doesn't do her any favours.On being asked about her role in investigating the root causes of immigration, she was asked the seemingly straightforward question about visiting the US southern border and the exchange unfolded thus:Harris: ""We've been to the border.""Holt: ""You've not been to the border?""Harris: ""And I haven't been to Europe.""It's a brief exchange that took place three years ago and Kamala Harris has performed ably in numerous interviews since.However, that particular interview, and its awkwardness, springs to mind after a campaign - so far - of limited exposure.Since Joe Biden stepped down, Harris has only conducted one sit-down TV interview. Even then, it was with running mate Tim Walz by her side.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerThat's one set-piece - or joint - interview in six weeks.It would be an astonishing lack of independent scrutiny for someone bidding to be a local parish councillor, let alone president of the United States.There remain questions unasked of Kamala Harris and the apparent reluctance to address them creates a sense of vulnerability.The enthusiasm for a change in the ticket has shored up the Democratic vote, no doubt, but Harris needs to extend her reach to the undecideds, independents and Republicans feeling reluctant about Trump.They need to know who she is and what she stands for. Harris has come a distance in the polls but they are starting to look sticky.She needs the extra votes.

After years of neglect, our waterways are now in an unacceptable state.""He added: ""Under this government, water executives will no longer line their own pockets whilst pumping out this filth.""Ofwat will also be allowed to ban water bosses' bonuses if they breach standards on the environment, their consumers and company finances - although the system is yet to be designed.Severn Trent chief Liz Garfield this year won a £584,000 bonus, despite the company being fined £2m for ""reckless"" sewage spills in the River Trent.The bill will also see monitoring of every sewage overflow and the reporting of discharges in real time, with data made available to the public who might want to swim or surf in that water.Although virtually all of England's 14,000 storm overflows are monitored for discharges of sewage into waterways often due to heavy rain, most of the additional 7,000 emergency overflows, which release sewage due to system failures like power outages, are currently not checked.The Environment Agency will be allowed to recover the costs of investigations from water firms, in a bid to restore the resourcing and expertise to the regulator that has been hollowed out in the last decade.As funding was cut by half between 2009-2019, enforcement actions plummeted and thousands of staff left, along with their expertise tackling water problems, though the previous prime minister, Rishi Sunak, did restore some resources in February.Decades of underinvestment and water companies are only part of the problem.A growing population, more extreme weather caused by climate change, farming pollution and cuts to the watchdogs have combined to leave waterways in a dire state.Just 14% of England's rivers and lakes are in good ecological health.How have green groups and industry reacted?Shaun Spiers, executive director of thintank Green Alliance, said: ""This is a useful first step and will address the public's concerns about inadequate regulation of polluting water companies.""But working out how to pay for all the upgrades, changes, and climate and nature measures is a ""more profound challenge"", he said.Ofwat recently blocked water companies from hiking bills by any more than £94 over the next five years, a third less than they had proposed.This is money they say they need to fix the problems, and which Labour could really do with, given the limited public finances to pay for infrastructure and nature and climate commitments.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeJames Wallace, chief executive of River Action UK, said he is pleased the new government is ""taking seriously this dreadful blight on our rivers caused by pollution, and this is an important first step"".But he called for an ""urgent review"" of the regulators.""Talking about CEO bonuses is not going to sort things out.

The largest recorded fires in the European Union killed 19 people in Greece, and blazes in western Amazonia brought filthy air to local towns.Today's major study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Earth System Science Data, finds carbon emissions from wildfires in 2023-2024 were 16% above average, spewing out 8.2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.And, had it not been a quiet fire season in the African savannahs, the global emission from wildfires would have been the greatest of any fire season on record since 2003, they said.What is an 'extreme' wildfire?There is no single definition of what constitutes an extreme fire, because it is relative to the location, said one of the authors Dr Douglas Kelley, from the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH).It could be measured by things like burned area, intensity, or how unusual they are, depending on the region.But they used three mega blazes in Canada, Greece, and western Amazonia last year as a benchmark.The current flames in Greece would count as an extreme fire because of its proximity to and potential damage to people, said fellow author Dr Joe McNorton from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).At 200 square kilometres, this year's fires in Greece are still much smaller than the 900 square kilometres burned last fire season.That's because the current flames are at the ""wildland-urban interface"", which brings with it ""potential loss of life, destruction, economic devastation"" said Dr McNorton.Climate change raised the chances of unprecedented fires last yearHuman-driven climate change made the tinderbox conditions of 2023-24 up to three times more likely in Greece, similar in Canada and 20 times more likely in western Amazonia, today's paper found.They then looked at ""how likely we are to get them in the future"", said Dr Kelley.If the world warms by up to 2C by 2100, sticking to Paris Agreement goals, they project such a fire in Canada will be two to three times more likely, but no change in Greece and western Amazonia.But if temperatures warm by more like 3C, extreme fires like last year will be up to 11 times more likely in Canada, three in Greece and 1.3 in western Amazonia.Other research shows the number of intense fires has been rising.How does climate change impact extreme fires?Climate change is ""clearly increasing"" fire conditions, said Dr Matthew Jones from the University of East Anglia.Warmer temperatures dry out forests, which make a fire ""more likely to spread"", said Dr Kelley. It can also cause more vegetation to grow, which provides more ""fuel"" for the fire.Human factors also influence fires, like starting them themselves, or breaking up the landscape, or how well they fight them.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerHow do fires impact climate change?Although the number of extreme fires is on the up, the total amount of land being burned has been decreasing.That is a bit of a ""red herring"" said Dr Jones, because it's due to a fall in the less harmful savannah fires, as things like agriculture break up the grassland, often bringing better protection or irrigation.But what scientists are really concerned about is the rise in wildfires in forests.Forest wildfires release more carbon emissions, pose a higher risk to people, take longer to recover, and mean the loss of huge carbon storage.Read more from Sky News:New warning about 'demise' of Great Barrier ReefBritain's smallest house 'at risk' due to climate changeThat's why global fire emissions have barely budged even though land area burned has fallen - and there's a fear global emissions from fires could soon increase.More extreme fires in Canada and western Amazonia are ""quite worrying... in ecosystems which hold a lot of carbon and in some cases, don't experience much fire today, so they haven't really adapted to it,"" said Dr Kelley.What can be done?Dr Clair Barnes from Imperial College London, who was not involved with the study, said she hopes the report will both ""guide preparations for wildfires, and help the world understand the simple fact that fires will keep getting worse until fossil fuels are replaced with renewable energy sources"".Scientists agree that emissions need to fall in order to avoid future risk - but that will take a long time to have an impact.In the meantime, the authors said, leaders should consider protecting forest boundaries, reducing the amount of natural fuel fire, imposing fire bans on high-risk days, and investing more in early warning prediction systems.",https://news.sky.com/story/how-climate-change-is-driving-extreme-fires-in-greece-13196440
06-08-2024,SkyNews,Climate,Customers demand water firms are held to account - but talks over fines reveal tension at heart of industry,"The £168m fines levied on three water companies by Ofwat are part of a slow - many argue far too slow - reckoning for the industry for the routine release of sewage via storm overflows.For Thames Water, predictably hit with the largest fine of £104m, close to the maximum penalty available to the regulator, it is also another blow to its credibility and bottom line in an increasingly desperate search for investors to secure its future.The sewage problem first. Storm overflows are the emergency release valve for our largely Victorian water infrastructure, in which rain water and wastewater ultimately share the same pipes.As the name suggests, their primary purpose is to divert water from the system during inundations, when the alternative would be for drain water to back up into people's homes.The grim reality of their operation, largely revealed thanks to a campaign of increased monitoring by concerned citizens, is that the use of storm outflows have become routine, with more than 460,000 incidents in 2023 - a 54% increase year-on-year.Ofwat found that all three companies - Thames Water, Yorkshire Water and Northumbrian Water - had failed not only to prevent routine spills, but often did not understand the scale of the problem.David Black, chief executive of Ofwat, told Sky News Thames Water did not even know about 300 of the 500 overflows in its network.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerFor Britain's largest water company, with 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley, this is another blow to its reputation and bottom line.Drowning in debt after a decade of mismanagement, Thames was already struggling to secure the fresh investment it needs to shore up the business and deliver infrastructure improvements.Earlier this year, chief executive Chris Weston described the company as ""uninvestable"" after existing shareholders pulled a £3.25bn equity injection, and last month said it only has enough cash to survive until next May without fresh funding.Read more from business:Asia's markets rebound after worldwide plungeMusk ramps up war of words with StarmerGoogle 'illegally maintained search monopoly'Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeThames has even argued that it should face lower fines to help protect its financial position in negotiations with the regulator.This captures the tension at the heart of the privatised water model and the regulator's role.It only works if water companies are attractive to investors, but customers demand that they be held to account with severe financial penalties that can undermine the proposition.As a £20bn company with £2bn of revenue and a monopoly on a fundamental utility, Thames Water remains attractive to investors, but the current ones will likely have to take a substantial hit first.Ofwat insists that the companies cannot recover these fines from customers, but bills will increase as part of an industry-wide settlement that will be agreed by the end of the year.The regulator approved average increases of 23% last month in exchange for £88bn of spending over the next five years, the bulk of it on daily operations, a figure the industry says is too low to deliver change.",https://news.sky.com/story/customers-demand-water-firms-are-held-to-account-but-talks-over-record-fines-reveal-tension-at-heart-of-industry-13191778

But Ofwat ruled there is only so much more bill-payers can take.What will the money pay for?The cash will help pay for nine new reservoirs, plus one already under way near Portsmouth, and seven large-scale water transfer schemes to channel water from wet parts of the country to drier.It will also pay for smart meters and to tackle leaks - progress on which has ""largely stalled"" in the last decade, NIC says.And it's worth remembering this is still a wet clutch of islands, and that we have some of the best water quality in the world.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeA public information campaign could help reduce consumption - which NIC says must fall from 141 litres per personper day to 118.But first the water industry needs to ""win back the support of the public"", said Jo Parker, vice president of engineering at the Institute of Water and chair of the Water and Sanitation Community Advisory Board of the Institution of Civil Engineers.""It is important that all parties - the water industry, professional bodies, government, regulators, NGOs and media work to restore faith in our water industry"".",https://news.sky.com/story/no-not-sewage-the-other-thing-rising-water-bills-needs-to-pay-for-13176538

Does it matter if my veggie sausage has been ultra-processed? Why will some people eat a prawn but not a cricket? Is lab-grown meat as nutritious as the real thing - and is it safe?Such questions about new ""alternative proteins"" will be answered, it is hoped, by a new multimillion pound venture to try to get more insects, fungi, and cultivated (sometimes called ""lab-grown"") meat onto our plates.The global population is growing dramatically, and so is its appetite for animal protein like cheese, ham and burgers.But animals raised for food can be terrible for the planet - destroying rainforests, adding to climate change and guzzling water - as well as for animal welfare and for our health in terms of fat and processing.Keeping everyone nourished without eating up more land that's needed to slow climate change and protects ecosystems is a dilemma that has fuelled the growth of the ""alternative protein"" sector.This covers a range of proteins that need much less energy and land, including insects, fungi, algae, microbes brewed like beer, cultivated meat, and even veggie sausages made from something like mushrooms.But the sector has hardly got off the ground - only 9% of protein sold in UK supermarkets comes from plants rather than animals, according to WWF, and cultivated meat hasn't yet been approved for human consumption.How many 'pollution hotspots' are there in your constituency, according to Friends of the EarthHunters to be paid to kill extra deer in Scotland in trial conservation schemeNew mothers breastfeed in front of endangered orangutan to try to show her how to care for babyBut alternative proteins could be worth £6.8bn a year and create 25,000 jobs by 2035, one analysis by the thinktank Green Alliance suggests, and boost food security.That's why the UK's innovation agency, UKRI, has just dished out £15m to the newly formed National Alternative Protein Innovation Centre (NAPIC), launching today.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerThe collaboration between different research groups is also backed by a further £23m from other stakeholders including business, farming groups, regulators and the third sector (charities, social enterprises and community groups).""We want to make alternative protein mainstream, for a really sustainable planet,"" said Professor Anwesha Sarkar, a food material scientist from Leeds University and NAPIC project leader.The aim is to build up more evidence about the health benefits and risks, how to keep farmers in work and how to test out what the British public will stomach.It will also look at how to unblock barriers to getting the products onto shop shelves, like outdated regulatory systems or slow testing processes.They hope to be the ""catalyst"" to scale up proteins and make the UK a ""global superpower"" in alternative proteins, Prof Sarkar said. The UK is striking out alone in Europe as the EU shies away from it, and Italy has even banned lab-grown meat.Singapore, Israel and pockets of the US have approved cultivated meat for human consumption, while the UK has allowed it in pet food.But the total £38m funding is a drop in the ocean of the global industry, which raised $1.6bn (£1.2bn) last year alone.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeMany UK start-ups are trying their hand in the sector, with Better Dairy brewing milk protein to make cheese in a process called precision fermentation, or Oxford's Ivy Farm taking a tiny sample of animal stem cells that it can then stimulate to make them replicate indefinitely.But not everyone is on board already.Some animal farmers fear yet another threat to their livelihoods, while others are worried that many alternative proteins are ""ultra-processed foods"" (UPFs) - a somewhat controversial term that has been the subject of much recent debate.But it ""all depends on what you are comparing it with"", said Professor Tim Spector, co-founder of the ZOE nutrition project and an expert on the health risks of ultra-processed food.He said ultra-processed alternative proteins are ""probably slightly better"" for you than UP meats, because they can contain more fibre and nutrients, he said.""Probably the choices we make on our food are the biggest single factors we can do as individuals to help our planet... so that's why I'm generally in favour of alternate proteins.""Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsIt will take some years before the project starts to deliver, and it will be up to government to translate the evidence into policy and legislation.A government spokesperson said: ""Everyone should have access to a varied, healthy diet and make their own choices about what they eat.""This government is committed to supporting a food system that produces sustainable, healthy and affordable food, while ensuring the right outcomes for consumers, farmers and food producers.""",https://news.sky.com/story/are-alternative-proteins-going-mainstream-this-multimillion-pound-new-project-hopes-so-13204117

Symptoms, complications and the new vaccine","A vaccine is being rolled out for RSV - short for respiratory syncytial virus - for the first time among pregnant women and older people.The common illness which infects 90% of children under the age of two circulates in the UK every winter, typically starting in October and peaking in December or January.The virus, which can be caught at all ages, is normally mild. But it can lead to severe lung infections, including pneumonia and infant bronchiolitis, and is a leading cause of infant mortality globally.Officials suggest the vaccine programme could ease the pressure on the NHS.Here is what you need to know about RSV, its symptoms, the complications it can cause and the vaccine rollout.What is RSV?RSV is short for respiratory syncytial virus.It is a very common virus and most children will have had it by the time they are two.However, it can reinfect older children and adults may also catch it. Older adults are particularly at risk of complications.Illness from the virus is the main cause of winter pressures in children's hospitals each year, leading to increased demands on paediatric intensive care units and cancelled operations.It accounts for approximately 20,000 hospital admissions in children under one year and is responsible for 20 to 30 infant deaths in the UK each year, according to the Department of Health and Social Care.What are the symptoms of RSV?Most children infected with RSV will only experience mild symptoms, including:• runny nose• decrease in appetite• coughing• sneezing• fever• wheezingThese symptoms usually come in stages, rather than all at once. In very young children, the only symptoms may be irritability, decreased activity, and breathing difficulties.What are the possible complications?RSV can cause a chest infection called bronchiolitis, which mainly affects children under two.It is usually mild and can be treated at home, according to the NHS, but it can be serious.Bronchiolitis is not the same as bronchitis, which causes a cough with lots of mucus and can affect people of all ages.The symptoms of bronchiolitis include:• breathing more quickly• finding it difficult to feed or eat• noisy breathing (wheezing)• becoming irritableSymptoms are usually worst between days three and five, and the cough usually gets better in three weeks, the NHS says.Some children have a higher risk of getting seriously ill with bronchiolitis, including children born very prematurely, those with a heart or lung condition or a weakened immune system.About three in 100 babies with bronchiolitis will need hospital treatment, according to Asthma + Lung UK.Read more from Sky News:Should you get the flu jab? Why it's not just a 'bad cold'Measles warning amid 'devastating resurgence' of diseaseWhen should you seek treatment?The NHS advises parents to call 999 or go to A&E if any of the following happens:• your child is having difficulty breathing - you may notice grunting noises or their tummy sucking under their ribs• there are pauses when your child breathes• your child's skin, tongue or lips are blue• your child is floppy and will not wake up or stay awake.Parents should ask for an urgent GP appointment or call 111 if any of the following happens:• your child has had a cold and it's getting worse• your child is feeding or eating much less than normal• your child has had a dry nappy for 12 hours or more, or shows other signs of dehydration• your baby is under 3 months and has a temperature of 38C or more, or is older than 3 months and has a temperature of 39C or higher• your baby feels hotter than usual when you touch their back or chest, or feels sweaty• your child is very tired or irritable.How does the vaccine rollout work?It started on 1 September, with women being offered it from 28 weeks into pregnancy and a one-off catch up programme to target those aged between 75 and 79 to ensure older people are protected going into this winter.The vaccine, which is given via injection into your upper arm, will be offered to eligible people through the NHS.Women should be offered the vaccine at around the time of their 28-week antenatal appointment, as getting vaccinated as close to 28 weeks as possible provides the best protection for babies, the NHS says.They advise speaking to your maternity service or GP surgery if you're 28 weeks pregnant or more and have not been offered the vaccine.People aged 75 to 79 should also be offered the vaccine by their GP surgery.What treatment is available if someone gets RSV?There is no specific treatment for RSV and instead treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms.The anti-viral drug ribavirin has been licensed for treating RSV and is sometimes used in severe cases, but its effectiveness has not been established.At home, symptoms of RSV and bronchiolitis can be treated with child paracetamol or ibuprofen. Saline nasal drops may make it easier for them to breathe, and feeding babies upright can also help.In hospital, a child with bronchiolitis may be given extra oxygen. If they are struggling to feed, they may be given food or fluids through a feeding tube. They may also be treated with nasal suction to get rid of excess mucus in the nostrils.'Vaccine can prevent trauma'Health minister Andrew Gwynne has shared his family's experience with RSV.His grandson was just weeks old when he contracted the virus, which developed into bronchiolitis.He was put in an induced coma by medics and spent two weeks in intensive care.""It was just heart-breaking watching this tiny, weeks old baby just helpless on the machine,"" Mr Gwynne said.""Around 20,000 babies a year are hospitalised with RSV, and very tragically between 20 and 30 a year will die from it.""And yet it's entirely preventable. So that's why this vaccine is so important.""I don't want any parent or grandparent to have to go through the trauma that we went through with our grandson with something that is entirely preventable, which RSV is.""Mr Gwynne added that the vaccine ""will ease enormous pressure on the NHS"".Christine Burlison, whose baby became seriously ill from the virus, is urging pregnant women to take up the new vaccine.Her daughter, Aria, was 11 days old when she began struggling to breathe and was taken to hospital.Doctors said she had developed bronchiolitis, a blocking of the airways in the lungs, as a result of RSV.""Now having the option of a vaccine that could prevent other families having to go through the same experiences as ours did is simply amazing,"" Ms Burlison said.""The most terrible thing that you can face as a parent is seeing your child struggling to breathe.""Having that protection for a newborn is all you could wish for.""",https://news.sky.com/story/what-is-rsv-symptoms-complications-and-when-parents-should-seek-medical-help-13012335
24-08-2024,SkyNews,Science & Tech,Two astronauts are stuck in space - how will they pass time (and survive) until 2025?,"It sounds like the plot of a sci-fi film: two astronauts are stranded in space and won't be coming back for another six months.Sunita ""Suni"" Williams and Commander Barry ""Butch"" Wilmore arrived at the International Space Station (ISS) in June as the first crew to test Boeing's new Starliner, which suffered helium leaks and thruster failures before it docked - raising questions over how safe it is for the return flight.Boeing has insisted the astronauts are not stuck and said ""there's no increased risk"" in bringing them back in the Starliner, but NASA has opted to bring them back on a SpaceX flight in February 2025 instead.They should have only been in space for eight days, but they've now been there for nearly three months.But do they have enough supplies for another six months, how are they coping mentally and what is day-to-day life like at the ISS?Size and facilitiesThe ISS is 356ft (109m) end-to-end, one yard shy of the full length of an American football field including the end zones.The living and work space, NASA says, is larger than a six-bedroom house, and has six sleeping quarters, two bathrooms, a gym, and a 360-degree view bay window.As you'll see later, it's not quite as luxurious as it sounds.Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore aren't alone; they're sharing the facilities with seven other astronauts from other missions; four of them fellow Americans and three of them Russians.Is there enough food, water and oxygen?Yes, there are reserve supplies up there to keep astronauts going for plenty of time.The space station has its own oxygen-generating systems, and about 50% of oxygen exhaled from carbon dioxide is recovered.As for water, the station has a urine-into-drinking-water recycling system, and a part of that system also captures moisture released into the cabin air from the crew's breath and sweat.Food supplies are a bit fancier. Meals are created at NASA's Space Food Systems Laboratory in Houston, where chefs focus on making food appetising as well as nutritious.Much of it is dehydrated, meaning it has to be filled up with water before being consumed, while some is ready-made and just needs to be heated.There's meat (barbecued beef brisket is one example of a meal on offer), eggs, vegetables, bread, savoury snacks and sweet treats in the station's kitchen.Crew members are also allowed to request some of their own personal favourites from off the shelves.In a video on NASA's YouTube channel, Ms Williams revealed her favourite commodity was Nutter Butter spread - and showed off a jar her family had sent up for her.When were supplies last sent?The spacecraft regularly receives more supplies from Earth, with the last one arriving on 6 August.Launched on a rocket from Kazakhstan on 30 May, the supplies included about three tonnes of food, fuel and other supplies for Ms Williams, Mr Wilmore and the seven other crew members on board.The crew can essentially place their orders for what they want to come on these crafts by speaking to Mission Control ahead of launches.That was good news for Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams, who were forced to ditch their personal suitcases before taking off in June to make room for extra equipment, meaning they've had to wear spare clothes that were already at the ISS upon arrival.Their own clothes finally arrived with the 6 August supplies, and more supplies are set to be sent up in a few months.Once supply ships are emptied at the ISS, the crew fill them with their rubbish before sending them back to Earth.How do you use a toilet without gravity?There are some things space-based movies just don't cover - but Ms Williams got into the grittier details of space life on NASA's YouTube channel.In the video filmed in 2012, Ms Williams showed off the toilet, which somewhat resembles one you might see on an aeroplane.Read more:Army barracks to house deep space radar to help protect the UKHow blasting 'glitter' into Mars' atmosphere could make it more habitableThe difference is there are two separate tubes to go in - one for urine and one for poo. The urine one, which is coloured yellow, is attached to the wall and almost looks like a vacuum cleaner - and fittingly it has a suction function to prevent gravity from causing a mess.The tube for poo looks like more of a typical toilet, with a seat too - though you have to hold on to a handle on the wall next to it to avoid floating away as you go.On the bright side, there's about half-a-dozen types of toilet paper stuffed into bags on the toilet walls, including wet wipes and disinfectant wipes in case ""things don't go correctly,"" as Ms Williams puts it.Astronauts are also each given toiletry kits that come with things like a toothbrush and toothpaste (which you have to either swallow or spit into a tissue) and a hairbrush - which Ms Williams says is pointless in space because gravity constantly keeps your hair upright.What about sleeping arrangements?Remarkably you can sleep on the floor, on the wall or on the ceiling.That's because without gravity, the crew never feel like they are lying down. It makes no difference whether they are on the floor, standing up or upside down - it all feels the same.So the ISS has sleeping stations about the size of phone booths that the crew get into, which consist of a sleeping bag and a pillow on the floor, wall and ceiling.Leisure timeWhen they aren't running space experiments, the crew can enjoy their view of Earth from the station's observatory deck, or head to the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) in the Tranquillity node - a fancy term for gym equipment.The ARED offers traditional upper and lower-body exercises, such as squats, dead lift, heel raises, bicep curls and bench press by using vacuum cylinders to replicate weights in gyms.The crew is encouraged to use it throughout their space stays, as muscle and bone loss is common on long missions.How are the pair feeling?They are both retired navy captains and longtime NASA astronauts who already have long space station missions behind them.Mr Wilmore, 61, and Ms Williams, 58, said going into this test flight that they expected to learn a lot about Starliner and how it operates.At their only news conference from space in July, they assured reporters they were keeping busy, helping with repairs and research, and expressed confidence in all the Starliner testing going on behind the scenes.""I have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem,"" Ms Williams told reporters.""That mantra you've heard, 'Failure is not an option,' that's why we are staying here now,"" Mr Wilmore said.""We trust that the tests that we're doing are the ones we need to do to get the right answers, to give us the data that we need to come back.""Mr Wilmore's wife Deanna told AP in early August that he is ""content"" at the space station, ""neither worrying nor fretting"".She said Mr Widmore, who is a longtime elder at a church in Texas, has faith God is in control, and that this gives his family ""great peace"".In its latest update, NASA said Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore both supported the plan to come back in a SpaceX craft ""fully"".What's happening now?Starliner will now return to Earth unmanned, while the two astronauts are set to return in February on aSpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft which is due to launch next month as part of a routine astronaut rotation mission.In a recent press conference, NASA administrator Bill Nelson said returning on the Starliner craft would be too dangerous.""Spaceflight is risky,"" he said. ""Even at its safest, and even at its most routine. A test flight by nature is neither safe nor routine.""Associate administrator Jim Free then added: ""The uncertainty in our [technological] margins is what drove our decision.""Many of Starliner's thrusters in the propulsion system overheated when fired and leaks of helium, used to pressurise the thrusters, appear to be connected to how frequently they are used, NASA's commercial crew manager Steve Stich previously explained.Speaking at the most recent press conference, Mr Stitch explained: ""The bottom line relative to bringing Starliner back is there was just too much uncertainty in the prediction of the thrusters.""If we had a model - if we had a way to accurately predict what the thrusters would do for the undock and all the way through the deorbit burn and through the separation sequence, I think we would have taken a different course of action.""But when we looked at the data and looked at the potential for thruster failures with a crew on board, and then getting into this very tight sequence of finishing the deorbit burn, which puts the vehicle on an entry, and then immediately manoeuvring from that into a step sequence to separate the service module and crew module, it was just too much risk for the crew.""Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for freeWill this be the longest anyone has spent in space?No - Russian Valeri Polyakov set that record in the mid-1990s, spending 437 days off Earth.And last year NASA astronaut Frank Rubio came back from a 371-day trip alongside Russian astronauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin, breaking the record for the longest amount of time spent in space by an American.That trip, much like this one, was prolonged by technical difficulties, and was only meant to take six months.",https://news.sky.com/story/how-will-two-astronauts-stuck-in-space-pass-time-and-survive-until-2025-13194024

06-09-2024,SkyNews,Science & Tech,"Inside clinic which uses HD cameras, radar and lasers during controversial high-tech MOTs","A new high-tech screening clinic co-founded by the boss of Spotify hopes to revolutionise healthcare by picking up signs of disease long before there are any symptoms.Neko Health uses high resolution cameras, lasers and radar to capture millions of data points around the body, checking for problems that could become serious and even life-threatening in future.It's the latest in a wave of companies offering controversial high-tech MOTs. Some doctors warn they may increase health inequities and add to NHS workload by referring people with potentially insignificant findings.Daniel Ek - the chief executive of the music streaming service - and his partner Hjalmar Nilsonne want to engage with the debate.In one of the clinic's softly-lit scanning rooms, Hjalmar tells me that healthcare has traditionally been about treating symptoms - ""reactive"", as he calls it.""We have to find a way to become more proactive, more preventative, to help people stay healthy longer,"" he says.""Instead of giving them medicine, give them long-term health.""Neko Health's first clinic outside its hometown of Stockholm, Sweden, is a world away from the busy London shopping street that it lies beneath.It looks like something straight out of sci-fi.In the centre of the room is a booth not unlike the teleporters in Star Trek.Step inside and nine cameras - HD, 3D and thermal - take more than 2,000 images to build a high-resolution map of every mole, freckle and blemish on your skin.If you return for annual checks it allows the clinic to track changes in size, pigmentation and other warning signs of skin cancer.Next to the booth there's more tech that could easily have been wielded by Star Trek's Dr McCoy on his starship crewmates.To spot early signs of cardiovascular disease lasers analyse the stiffness of arterial walls, shimmering patterns of green light check blood circulation and blood pressure cuffs take simultaneous readings on all four limbs.There's a blood sample taken too to measure cholesterol, blood glucose, biomarkers of inflammation and lots more.In less than an hour millions of data points are collected and analysed, with a doctor explaining the findings.For the record I, like 79% of those scanned in the Stockholm clinic's first year, got a clean bill of health.But 14% of the clients in Sweden needed medical treatment for something picked up in the health check. And 1% had potentially life-saving care for serious problems they were previously unaware of.More than three-quarters of customers have booked again for a year's time. Most, it seems, consider the checks worth the £300 cost.It's a growing market.You can pay several thousands to companies offering whole-body MRI scans to see what's going on below the skin.Kim Kardashian gave a celebrity buzz to a company called Prenuvo by referring to its scanner as a ""life-saving machine"" in an Instagram post.The shift towards disease prevention has big champions.Professor Sir John Bell, now of the Ellison Institute of Technology in Oxford, was instrumental in creating the UK Biobank, Genomics England, and more recently the Our Future Health study - all initiatives to dive deep into patient data to spot signs of disease.He says preventative health checks will be the norm in the next 10 years.Not the rudimentary lifestyle questionnaires the NHS offers to mid-life patients now. There'll be far more tech - and AI - running the rule over our inner health.But it's a mindshift for the NHS.""People don't want to talk to you about cardiac problems until you have chest pain, and then they're quite keen to talk to you,"" Professor Bell says.Be the first to get Breaking NewsInstall the Sky News app for free""But the trouble is, they picked it up too late because for the last 35 or 40 years it's been accumulating in your cardiac vessels. You've been asymptomatic, so nobody's done anything about it.""Understanding which diseases you have and capturing them fast at their earliest stage will mean you have a much longer, healthy life expectancy.""But other doctors are more cautious.Dr Saira Ghafur, a respiratory physician at Imperial College London, is concerned that the people who are most likely to have underlying health problems are the least likely to be able to afford private check-ups. It could make existing health inequalities even worse, she fears.There's also the risk private health checks will add to NHS waiting lists, Dr Ghafur tells me. They'll pick up lots of issues that need NHS follow-up but ultimately turn out to be nothing to worry about.And then there's the lack of evidence that the issues picked up actually matter.""We have to make sure that we're doing prevention right,"" she says. ""For that, we need a very strong evidence base.""But we are going to have to wait many years to be able to show that doing this screening, collecting these data points, has actually resulted in better (health) outcomes.""That hasn't deterred people from signing up to Neko Health.

05-09-2024,SkyNews,Science & Tech,"Giving children salt water nasal drops can cut duration of a cold and stop it spreading, study suggests","Giving children a solution made up of salt and water can cut the duration of a cold by two days, researchers have suggested.A study found that cold symptoms lasted for an average of six days after using salt water nasal drops - also known as saline solution - compared to eight days after using typical cold medicine.It could also cut the chance of passing colds on to other family members.Professor Steve Cunningham, from the University of Edinburgh who worked on the ELVIS-Kids randomised controlled trial, said: ""Children have up to 10 to 12 upper respiratory tract infections - what we refer to as colds - per year, which have a big impact on them and their families.""There are medicines to improve symptoms, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, but no treatments that can make a cold get better quicker.""We found that children using salt water nose drops had cold symptoms for an average of six days when those with usual care had symptoms for eight days.""The children receiving salt water nose drops also needed fewer medicines during their illness.""Reducing the duration of colds in children means that fewer people in their house also get a cold, with clear implications for how quickly a household feels better and can return to their usual activities like school and work.""He said the 2.6% salt water concentration cannot currently be bought over-the-counter and needs to be made up by parents, which his team will help with by releasing ""simple instructions"" and a video within the next few days.Explaining how salt may work to cut the length of colds, Prof Cunningham said: ""Salt is made up of sodium and chloride. Chloride is used by the cells lining the nose and windpipes to produce hypochlorous acid within cells, which they use to defend against virus infection.Read more from Sky News:Royal Navy service member diesUnaired clip from The Jeremy Kyle Show released for first timeBotched Fyre Festival due for a comeback""By giving extra chloride to the lining cells, this helps the cells produce more hypochlorous acid, which helps suppress viral replication, reducing the length of the virus infection, and therefore the duration of symptoms.""407 children aged up to six took part in the study, which was presented at the European Respiratory Society Congress in Vienna.Some 301 children developed a cold and the parents of 150 of these were given sea salt and taught to make and apply salt water nose drops to the children's noses (three drops per nostril, a minimum of four times per day, until well).The other 151 children had usual care.Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky NewsIn children given the drops, fewer households (46%) reported family members catching a cold versus the typical methods (61%).Some 82% of parents said the nose drops helped their child get better quickly while 81% said they would use nose drops in the future.Dr Matthew Siggins, research fellow at the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the study, said the research showed a degree of success with reducing the length of symptoms, ""albeit only moderately"".He said results of the trial matched a larger study in adults conducted at Southampton University, which also showed the application of simple saline water reduced symptoms by around two days on average.He called for future studies to help design sprays that can more effectively suppress symptoms and spread.",https://news.sky.com/story/giving-children-salt-water-nasal-drops-can-cut-duration-of-a-cold-and-stop-it-spreading-study-suggests-13210224
